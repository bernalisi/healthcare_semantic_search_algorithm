            "study_description In 2019, three monoclonal antibodies(mAbs) that target calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP),or its receptor,were approved in Italy for both episodic and chronic migraine prophylaxis:erenumab,galcanezumab and fremanezumab. Given the recent introduction of anti-CGRP mAbs on the market, real-world evidence on utilization patterns and the characteristics of patients using anti-CGRP mAbs is still scarce. Therefore, this study aims to re-use routinely collected healthcare data from the administrative database of Tuscany region, Italy, in order to: 1) provide real-world evidence on patients initiating an anti-CGRP mAb, 2) describe the utilization pattern of these medications up to 15 months of follow-up and 3) observe the consumption of triptans, proxy of migraine occurrence, before and after initiation of anti-CGRP therapy. A descriptive, population-based, pharmaco-epidemiological cohort study on the utilization of anti-CGRP mAbs in clinical practice will be performed using the regional administrative datasource of Tuscany, in Italy. Subjects with ‚â•1 dispensing of any mAb anti-CGRP (ATC N02CD*) reimbursed by the National Health Service between April 1, 2019 to June 30, 2021 and none in the past will be identified and labelled as \"new users\". The date of the first dispensing will be considered as the cohort entry date. New users will be described in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics. Patients non-persistent to the initial anti-CGRP drug and with a dispensing of an anti-CGRP mAb other the index drug received will be identified and labelled as ‚Äúdiscontinuers‚Äù and \"switchers\" respectively. Additionally, patients with ‚â• 2 triptan dispensings in the 6 months before cohort entry will be selected . Among them, the mean monthly number of dosage units dispensed during the six months before cohort entry will be compared with that observed in the same population of users within five follow-up windows (i.e. 0-3, 3-6, 6-9, 9-12 and 12-15 months).\n",

We conducted a nested case-control study using the Syst√®me National des Donn√©es de Sant√©. The source population was patients ‚â•18 years of age, affiliated to the General Health Insurance Scheme in 2010 with no history of adrenal insufficiency. Cases were patients presenting with a first adrenal insufficiency event between 01/01/2015 and 31/12/2017. Adrenal insufficiency was defined as the presence of both a hospital stay with a diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency (ICD-10 codes E271 to E274), and a first delivery of hydrocortisone ¬±30 days before/after hospital admission. Each case was matched to up to 10 controls on age (¬±2 years), sex and corticosteroid exposure in the 3 years prior to the index date. Statin exposure was measured in the 5 years prior to the index date using different definitions: history of use, cumulative use and intensity of last statin used. A 6-month censoring period for exposure was applied before the index date to avoid potential detection bias. The association was estimated using conditional logistic regression adjusted for confounders included in a disease risk score. Analyses were stratified on age, sex and history of corticosteroid use.\n",

Previous studies that found a positive association between benzodiazepine exposure and suicidal behaviours were confounded by indication bias. The association between benzodiazepines and suicidal behaviours has to be clarified to inform evidence-based practice guidelines for suicidal risk management. The main objective of the present study is to estimate the risk of suicide attempt and suicide associated with benzodiazepines. This is a case crossover study (CCO) in a national healthcare claims and hospitalisations databases including patients ‚â•16y, with hospitalised suicide attempt or suicide between 2013 and 2016, and at least one benzodiazepine dispensing within the 120 days before their act (i.e., the observation period). Individuals are separated according to the identification of psychiatric history over the year preceding the observation period. For each patient, frequency of benzodiazepine dispensing is compared between a risk period (days -30 to -1 before the event) and two matched reference periods (days -120 to -91, and -90 to -61). Self-controlled CCO analyses are adjusted for psychotropic drugs use within the observation period. A CCO considering a negative control explores residual indication bias, and a case-case-time-control analysis addresses time-trend bias.\n",

            "study_description There are still relatively limited data on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy. Even scarcer are data on how vaccination during pregnancy or lactation protects the infant during the first months of life. We presented an updated overview of the evidence on COVID-19 maternal immunisation including studies published between January 1, 2021, through June 7, 2022. We identified 29 studies, of which 21 reported results on vaccine safety and 12 reported results on vaccine effectiveness (VE) during pregnancy. None of the studies reported on the potential protective effect of maternal immunisation during lactation of breastfed infants. Findings from included studies suggest that mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are not associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes in pregnant women and their neonates and are effective in reducing the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in both mothers and infants. The low incidence of maternal COVID-19-related hospitalisation and severe disease precluded the studies from providing precise VE estimates for these outcomes. Despite the number of published studies, there remain major gaps in our knowledge of how COVID-19 vaccines impact pregnancy and newborns. Strong evidence is needed based on large population-based studies that use rigorous methods and include diverse populations that could confirm these initial findings. Evidence is still scarce on ideal timing of immunisation and number of doses to provide protection to the pregnant women and their infants, vaccine safety during the first trimester of pregnancy, vaccine effectiveness of boosters and against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as evidence on safety and effectiveness of viral vector vaccines or inactivated vaccines. Additionally, whether COVID-19 vaccine-derived antibodies transferred from the mothers to their infants during breastfeeding provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection or health complications remains to be elucidated.\n",

            "study_description ARBs and ACE inhibitors are the most commonly prescribed antihypertensive drugs among adults in the world. They are first-line drugs for hypertension, heart failure and myocardial infarction. While large clinical trials and meta-analysis post marketing authorization showed no association between antihypertensive and fall, several observational studies on large cohorts of real-life patients have shown the opposite. Although these studies have assessed the risk of fall and trauma associated with RAS as a class, whether differences exist between ARBs and ACE inhibitors is unclear. Indeed, ARBs and ACE inhibitors have different pharmacodynamic mechanisms, which may in turn induce different antihypertensive effects. The primary mechanism of action of ARBs is to reduce AT1 receptor activation, even more effectively than ACE inhibitors. ARBs also promote higher activation of AT2 receptors, which enhances their antihypertensive action.   Determine whether use of ARBs, when compared with ACE inhibitors, is associated with an increased risk of fall and trauma-related hospitalization among of 65 years and older a multivariable Cox proportional-hazards outcome models using\n",

            "study_description This study is a retrospective cohort study utilizing a longitudinal US healthcare claims data source (HealthCore Integrated Research Database HIRD) and longitudinal data collected from linked Swedish National Registers. The study includes women aged >=50 years with an intact uterus and no prior use of vaginal estrogens. The three exposed treatment groups are new users of unopposed low-dose vaginal estrogen (LDVE), unopposed moderate-dose vaginal estrogen (MDVE), and unopposed high-dose Premarin VC (HDVC) in US only (regardless of other use of prior hormone therapy). The two comparator groups are non-users of vaginal estrogen who are women over age 50 with at least one gynecological visit without prior or current use of vaginal estrogen at the time of the gynecological visit but, regardless of their prior use of hormone therapy, and E+P HT new users with no prior use of hormone therapy. Diagnosis of endometrial cancer will be identified in the US using codes that have been validated in the HIRD, and in Sweden using records in the Swedish Cancer Register. Covariates will include patient demographics, comorbidities, medications, and healthcare utilization. In the primary analysis, adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) will be calculated using Cox proportional hazards models to compare the hazard of endometrial cancer between 1) unopposed LDVE and non users of vaginal estrogen, 2) unopposed MDVE and non-users of vaginal estrogen, 3) unopposed HDVC with non-users of vaginal estrogen (US only).\n",

To address these study aims, we will retrieve data from three large international clinical trials to develop the model, and use data from the International Severe Asthma Registry and Singapore asthma cohort to externally validate the model and assess its clinical utility. We are optimistic about the long-term demand for the outputs of this research, its potential for sustainability and growth, and its ability to improve patient care and outcomes, and advance Precision Medicine and Digital Health research in respiratory research.\n",

            "study_description Rationale and background: The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with the use of chlormadinoe acetate (CMA) is currently unknown as the available data have significant limitations and lack data on direct comparison between levonorgestrel- (LNG) and CMA-containing combined oral contraceptives (COCs).   Study design: this is a retrospective cohort study and will be conducted as substitute for the RIVET-Case Control study, which was discontinued due to slow recruitment of both cases and controls. Following several attempts to enhance the recruitment in RIVET-CC, the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC) of the European Medicines Agency recommended a pooled analysis of 4 prospective cohort studies in order to clarify whether CMA/EE-containing COCs carry a different VTE risk compared to LNG/EE-containing COCs. Participants will be identified retrospectively from a pooled dataset which comprises four large, controlled, prospective, non-interventional active surveillance studies that focused on the risk of VTE associated with the use of combined oral contraceptives (LASS/EURAS-OC, INAS-OC, INAS-SCORE, INAS-FOCUS). All data were prospectively collected by ZEG Berlin and follow the EURAS/INAS study design. Inclusion and exclusion criteria, the method of patient recruitment and follow-up as well as research methods were similar across studies.  Gedeon Richter and its Collaborators requested this Study in agreement with the competent European regulatory authority and supports it by an unconditional grant to ZEG. Gedeon Richter and its Collaborators are not actively involved in the conduct of the Study.\n",

Such infants are still affected by dangerous complications occurring during the neonatal period that often cause brain damage. It requires more specialized monitoring of brain function during this critical period. In recent years, many studies on very premature infants have shown that aEEG has a high predictive value for both short-term and long-term outcome. Most recent studies have shown that an aEEG performed in the early hours or during the first days or weeks of life can predict the neurodevelopment of preterm infants at 1 year of corrected age (Bayley Scale).

            "study_description Patients with inflammatory autoimmune diseases (IAD) are often severely immunocompromised and exposed to potentially serious infections. Pneumocystis jirovecii (P. jirovecii) is an opportunistic fungus responsible to Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP),especially in immunocompromised patients. PJP induces chronic or acute respiratory failure and can lead to intensive care unit admission and potentially death. Among IAD patients with PJP, rate of mortality is high,varying between 62% to 80%. Primary prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for the majority of patients or aerosolized pentamidine or atovaquone used in case of TMP-SMX intolerance or allergy,is effective to prevent PJP occurrence and reduces its related mortality. Nevertheless, TMP-SMX exposes to potentially serious side effects such as toxidermia, drug-induced liver or renal injury, cytopenia or lupus induction. To date, except for HIV-infected patients, no clear recommendation exists about the use of PJP prophylaxis among patients with IAD. In 2019, prescription of TMP-SMX for PJP prevention among IAD patients remains highly dependent of local practice. This is a retrospective cohort study planned to assess the effect of PJP prophylaxis to prevent PJP among IAD patients treated with prolonged high dose steroids for IAD. Secondary aims are: To determine safety of PJP prophylaxis among patients with IAD and prolonged high dose steroids, globally and by IAD, To describe the use of PJP prevention in France in patients with IAD and prolonged high dose steroids, and factors associated with PJP prevention, To assess the incidence of PJP among patients with IAD and prolonged high dose steroids, by IAD, To identify risk factors for PJP development among patients with IAD and according to each IAD, To describe overall mortality rates and PJP mortality rates in IAD patients, globally and by IAD, To assess the incidence of hospitalizations (and their main cause) in incident IAD patients.\n",

            "study_description Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurobehavioral disorders of adolescents. In addition to ADHD, patients with ADHD also have many comorbidities such as anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, substance abuse, and autism spectrum disorder. Therefore, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that comorbidity evaluation be performed at least once when diagnosing ADHD as one of the key action statements in their 2019 clinical practice guideline. Especially, ADHD is closely related to depressive disorder. There are previous studies on high comorbidity rate, biological linkage or causality, and its clinical outcomes. When establishing a treatment strategy for ADHD patients with depression, the clinical hurdles for the use of antidepressants are concerns about changes in the patients‚Äô condition (i.e., suicidality, etc.) and an increase in adverse effects. Although the first-line treatment for adolescent ADHD and depressive disorder is recommended in different guidelines, the evidence for safety evaluation of concomitant use of those drugs is sparse. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the safety of the co-use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), the first recommended drug for adolescent depression, in ADHD patients (Adolescent ADHD and SSRI Use in Real-world data: ASSURE study). We also aimed to evaluate the safety outcome within the SSRI class as a head-to-head study.\n",

            "study_description The composite preparation containing sodium metamizole, caffeine and drotaverine hydrochloride VEMONIS FEMI¬Æ is used for the symptomatic treatment of pain, pain associated with smooth muscle spasms (renal colic, dysmenorrhea, intestinal colic, irritable bowel syndrome, cholecystitis, cholangitis) when the use of other drugs is contraindicated or ineffective. Metamizole is a pyrazolone derivative, belongs to NSAIDs with analgesic, spasmolytic and antipyretic effects. The analgesic effect of this substance is based on inhibition of COX3 occurring mainly in the CNS, which results in decreased synthesis of PGE2, which reduces the sensitivity of nociceptors to pain mediators. Metamizole metabolites are CB1, which are part of the descending antinociceptive system. The third mechanism associated with the analgesic properties is the activation of the endogenous opioid system. Metamizole differs from other NSAIDs as it has a clear spasmolytic effect. The mechanism responsible for this effect may be the inhibition of intracellular release of calcium ions, which causes smooth muscle relaxation. Furthermore, it inhibits the accumulation of inositol phosphate by direct inhibition of phospholipase C or by impairing the activation of the receptor that is combined with protein G. Caffeine is a naturally occurring methylxanthine used as a CNS stimulant. Its other effects: relaxation of smooth muscles, stimulation of the heart muscle and stimulation of diuresis. It‚Äôs also effective in treating certain types of headaches. Caffeine inhibits phosphodiesterase, an enzyme inactivating the cyclic adenosine monophosphate. It shows antagonistic effects against adenosine receptors A(1), A(2A), A(2B) involved in nociception. It is an additive to many painkillers because it increases their analgesic effect by accelerating their absorption. Drotaverine is a relaxant, structurally similar to papaverine but with a much stronger effect. It is a selective inhibitor of PDE4 in smooth muscles.\n",

Cardiovascular evidence for older second-line agents, such as sulfonylureas, and direct head-to-head comparisons, including with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors, are lacking, leaving a critical gap in our understanding of the relative effects of T2DM agents on cardiovascular risk and on patient-centered safety outcomes. The Large-Scale Evidence Generations Across a Network of Databases for T2DM (LEGEND-T2DM) initiative is a series of systematic, large-scale, multinational, real-world comparative cardiovascular effectiveness and safety studies of all 4 major second-line anti-hyperglycemic agents including SGLT2 inhibitor, GLP1 receptor agonist, DPP4 inhibitor and sulfonylureas and leverages the Observational Health Data Science and Informatics (OHDSI) community that provides access to a global network of administrative claims and electronic health record (EHR) data sources. Across data sources, LEGEND-T2DM will identify all adult, T2DM patients who newly initiate a traditionally second-line T2DM agent, including individuals with and without established cardiovascular disease. Using an active comparator, new-user cohort design, LEGEND-T2DM will execute all pairwise class-vs-class and drug-vs-drug comparisons in each data source that meet a minimum patient count of 1,000 per arm and extensive study diagnostics that assess reliability and generalizability through cohort balance and equipoise to examine the relative risk of cardiovascular and safety outcomes. The primary cardiovascular outcomes include a 3-point and a 4-point composite of major adverse cardiovascular events, and series of safety outcomes.\n",

            "study_description Rationale and background: Baricitinib is approved in Europe for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults. Although the potential for off-label use in paediatric patients is considered low, baricitinib has not yet been studied in children and adolescents and hence its use in this population is classified as a safety concern (missing information) in the EU-Risk Management Plan for baricitinib. Lilly has proposed this study in order to provide a more systematic evaluation of use in children and adolescents in Europe. Understanding the proportion of baricitinib prescribing that is off-label to children and adolescents will help quantitate the level of this safety concern. Research question and objectives: This study‚Äôs primary objective is to evaluate the proportion of baricitinib prescribing that occurs off-label in paediatric patients (defined as less than 18 years of age). As a secondary objective, if paediatric use is ‚â•5 patients, this study aims to describe paediatric patients who receive a prescription for baricitinib in terms of total number of patients, demographics (age and sex) and select baseline diagnoses codes. Study design: This observational study will use a descriptive cohort design to characterize off-label prescribing of baricitinib in United Kingdom (UK) paediatric patients.  Population: The setting is general care practices within the UK, limited to the practices that contribute to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Patients will be retrospectively selected from the CPRD (both GOLD and Aurum) based on first occurrence of baricitinib within the database from April 2017 (date of baricitinib launch in the UK) to June 2020.\n",

            "study_description In patients with uncontrolled moderate to severe asthma (i.e. GINA step 4), GINA recommends to either increase the dose of ICS to high dose ICS+LABA or to add a LAMA (tiotropium) on top of medium dose ICS+LABA. Although not recommended by GINA, it is likely that ‚Äì in real life ‚Äì there are also patients who get stepped-up to high dose ICS+LABA+LAMA. As of today, which patients respond best to which treatment option ‚Äì in real life - is yet unknown.   For this reason, we will conduct a retrospective cohort study, in patients with uncontrolled moderate to severe asthma (step 4) initiating one of the treatment options of GINA treatment step-up.  Our study period is from 2010-2020 and we will use data from 4 databases from 4 European countries: the Netherlands (IPCI), Denmark (Aarhus), Italy (HSD) and UK (CPRD).  The study population will consist of all patients with asthma, aged 18-65 years with at least 1 year of database history and active follow-up during the study. Within this cohort, patients with treatment step up from GINA step 4 (medium dose ICS/LABA) will be selected.  The main objectives are as following:  ‚Ä¢\tIdentify the main drivers of prescribing any of the three step-up treatment options ‚Ä¢\tIdentify patient features/characteristics associated with response to the specific treatment regimens In addition, we have the following secondary objectives:  ‚Ä¢\tTo investigate differences in Health Care Resources utilisation in the year prior vs. year after treatment step-up (high dose ICS+LABA, medium dose ICS+LABA+LAMA, high dose ICS+LABA+LAMA)  ‚Ä¢\tTo investigate differences in rescue medication use (SABA) and OCS use in the year prior vs year after treatment step-up ‚Ä¢\tTo study differences in treatment characteristics (proportion of patients discontinuing treatment, switching (i.e. treatment step down)) after initiation of one of the 3 treatment options ‚Ä¢\tTo research the types of LAMAs being used\n",

            "study_description Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease characterized by progressive joint destruction, systemic complications, reduced survival, and a profoundly reduced quality of life among those affected. Baricitinib is a Janus kinase selective inhibitor indicated for treatment of moderate-to-severe RA. Data from clinical trials demonstrate that baricitinib is an effective therapy for RA. During these clinical studies, there was a numerical imbalance in reported venous thromboembolism (VTE) between baricitinib and placebo-treated patients. However, given the limited placebo-treated patients follow-up, it was not possible to support a definitive assessment of the risk of VTE associated with baricitinib treatment, or with other outcomes such as major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).  The baricitinib marketing authorization holder initiated an international study program to evaluate the risk of VTE, MACE, serious infection, and tuberculosis in a large number of patients treated with baricitinib or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) for RA in multiple country data sources. The present study aims to evaluate the safety of patients with RA treated with baricitinib in the French population, using the French nationwide claims database (Syst√®me National des Donn√©es de Sant√© - SNDS).  The cohort will include all patients aged >18 years with RA, who are included in SNDS and are newly treated by baricitinib or TNFi (absence of use in the 180-day period prior to cohort entry) between September 2017 and December 2019. All patients will have a 2-year database history and will be followed until 31 December 2019 or until the first of the following events: occurrence of an event of interest, discontinuation of study treatment plus 30 days or switch to a medication in another exposure cohort, initiation of a concomitant bDMARD or tsDMARD, health plan disenrollment, or death if identified.\n",

            "study_description The number of patients enrolled in the pre-authorisation clinical studies with Human-cl rhFVIII was 135 (see Section 2.2.1), which is considered adequate to provide relevant information on general safety aspects and to demonstrate the efficacy of Human-cl rhFVIII in terms of its ability to restore factor VIII levels and stop or prevent bleeding. However, data from pre-authorisation studies are insufficient to estimate all aspects of therapy with FVIII products, especially with respect to immunogenicity (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/144533/2009).

            "study_description Men appear to have an approximately 50% higher risk for infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) than women, also when adjusted for other risk factors. Male sex also predicts a 50-60% increased risk for critical care admission and/or death in covid-19. One proposed mechanism is that androgen signaling facilitates entry of SARS-CoV-2 into host cells. Internalization of the SARS-Cov-2 virus relies on proteases such as the Transmembrane Protease Serine 2 (TMPRSS2). The regulation of TMPRSS2 expression is androgen-dependent, suggesting that androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) could potentially have a protective effect against covid-19. More than a dozen clinical trials are being planned or are already ongoing to evaluate the effects of ADT in men with Covid-19. This rapid progression from hypothesis to clinical trials also raises concern. ADT is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in men with prostate cancer. Even short-term ADT may increase the risk. The benefit-risk ratio for exposing men with covid-19 could therefore be supported by further observational data, indicating that ADT in men with prostate cancer confers protection against severe covid-19. The aim of this study was to estimate the impact of ADT on excess mortality in men with prostate cancer during the initial peak of covid-19 in the spring of 2020 compared to previous years.\n",

It is often treated with medications called ‚Äòanticholinergics‚Äô or ‚Äòantimuscarinics‚Äô, but some studies have associated these with memory problems and a higher risk dementia if used for a long time.   However, we don‚Äôt know whether these medications actually cause this increased risk or are simply used more often in people already at risk of dementia. We also don‚Äôt know how the risk varies among different patient groups or types of anticholinergics.   Data from medical records are increasingly used for dementia research, but there are challenges in their use. Dementia diagnoses can be delayed, not made at all, or not promptly communicated across healthcare services, so this needs careful analysis.    We will analyse the general practitioner (GP) and hospital records of >700,000 patients aged ‚â•50 years in England prescribed bladder anticholinergics. We will examine whether, all other factors being equal, patients taking long-term bladder anticholinergics develop dementia more often than patients with only a single prescription. We will then estimate how this risk varies by duration of treatment, for specific patient groups, and for specific bladder drugs. As we also don‚Äôt fully understand how these medications affect the brain, we will also examine whether delirium or fractures are more common with longer term use of bladder anticholinergics.\n",

            "study_description The increased mortality and morbidity of COVID-19 in patients with hypertension is an association that has been observed in a number of initial epidemiological studies. From these evidence, it has emerged the hypothesis that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (ACE-Is) could act as a potential risk factor for fatal Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by up-regulating ACE2. Because of the insufficient evidence to determine how to appropriately manage hypertension in the setting of COVID-19, there is an opportunity for the research community to better outline the role of ACE2 in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, while clinical and epidemiological data are needed to determine if there is an association between the use of ACE-Is, ARBs, or both and COVID-19 mortality and morbidity. The study aims to investigate the association between use of RAAS inhibitors and severe outcomes (i.e. death, admission in ICU) among hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19. The study will be conducted using data of healthcare administrative databases from two Local Health Authorities in Lombardy (the Italian region mostly hit by the epidemic) currently covering a patient population of around 2.3 million residents. A registry containing information on confirmed COVID-19 cases will be linked with the administrative databases. RAAS inhibitors use will be defined on the basis on reimbursement history.

In hereditary TTR-related amyloidosis, more than 100 gene mutations on transthyretin gene have been identified to be responsible for symptoms such as nerve and neurological peripheral damages. Two main phenotypic forms are encountered: transthyretin familial amyloid polyneuropathy (TTR-FAP) which is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease and transthyretin familial amyloid cardiomyopathy (TTR-FAC), occurring in 80% of patients with TTR-FAP. Prevalence of these two conditions are not well-known: TTR-FAP was estimated at 1/1.106 in general population whereas the French national registry has recorded 482 patients from 1989 to 2014. For TTR-FAC, there is a lack of epidemiological data. TTR-related amyloidosis also includes senile amyloidosis occurring predominantly in men aged over 60 years, in which amyloid deposits are derived from wild transthyretin. Prevalence of WT-TTR in the general population is not known either. Vyndaqel¬Æ (tafamidis) is a TTR tetramer stabilizer authorized in the EU market since 2012, for the treatment of TTR-FAP in stage 1 to delay neurologic peripheral impairment and is actually under clinical study for TTR-cardiomyopathy (senile amyloidosis + TTR-FAC). In the Transparency Committee's opinion of 2012, the medical value of Vyndaqel¬Æ was considered moderate and added medical value was considered minor. In this report, 200 patients were estimated eligible to receive Vyndaqel¬Æ. As part of the five-yearly renewal of tafamidis on the list of reimbursable products, its target population and modalities of use need to be assessed in 'real life‚Äô. Thus, Pfizer aims to conduct a real-life study to provide new data regarding TTR-amyloidosis and tafamidis use. This epidemiological study will rely on the French amyloidosis network.  fr\n",

Recently, their use has been reported as being associated with the onset of Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP), a rare but potentially fatal disease that causes blood clots to form in small blood vessels throughout the body. This issue is being evaluated by the European Union‚Äôs Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC), a regulatory body responsible for assessing and monitoring the safety of human medicines. This study simply describes how often TTP occurs after patients are prescribed fluoroquinolones. To allow contextualisation of the results, the same analysis has been done in two other groups of patients prescribed other antibiotic medicines. The first group are patients prescribed broad spectrum penicillins. The second group are patients who have been prescribed azithromycin. The results of this study will be used by the PRAC in its decision-making process by helping to decide if regulatory action needs to be taken to protect patients taking fluoroquinolones.\n",

            "study_description The use of healthcare data, generated through the delivery of normal clinical care is increasingly being proposed as a source of evidence to support not only drug development and regulatory decision-making but also to understand the physiology and pathogenesis of diseases.  Use of multiple electronic health care databases is important not only to increase sample size but also to investigate country specific differences, differences by type of databases (e.g. primary vs. secondary care) or to replicate findings. One of the challenges however are the differences between the databases with regard to the underlying structures and semantic mapping. A common data model could help harmonise healthcare data across multiple data sets and provide a mechanism to allow the conduct of multi-database, international studies.  The European Health Data and Evidence Network (EHDEN) project (https://www.ehden.eu/) is an international project supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI) aiming to standardize health care data to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model (OMOP CDM) and to develop and implement tools to facilitate research on large electronic health care databases.  One of the objectives of the EHDEN project is to test existing methodologies but also to develop new methodologies and analytical tools to conduct (pharmaco)epidemiological research using electronic health care databases mapped to the OMOP CDM. To investigate the validity and functionality of this approach, we want to conduct a drug-utilisation study using EHR data. As proof of concept study we want to conduct a drug utilisation studies on respiratory drug use in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This research is important and relevant as asthma and COPD are prevalent conditions, primarily treated in primary care.\n",

Further healthcare resource utilization and associated costs will be examined for patients with CKD. The study population represents three cohorts of adults in Alberta, Canada with: 1) CKD, 2) T2DM, and 3) T2DM/CKD. These cohorts will be defined using published definitions of diagnosis codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification/International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision, Canada. The diagnosis codes for these conditions can be in any position in the Discharge Abstract Database (DAD), National Ambulatory Care Reporting System (NACRS), or Practitioner Claims datasets between April 1, 2010 and March 31, 2019. Patients with CKD will also be identified utilizing laboratory tests of estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria stage (based on albumin:creatinine ratio, protein:creatinine ratio and the dipstick test). Further inclusion criteria and published/validated algorithms were applied to define the three study cohorts of interest. A data request will be placed with Alberta Health to provide data for patients meeting the study inclusion criteria. Datasets of interest include the DAD, NACRS, Population Registry, Practitioner Claims, Pharmaceutical Information Network, Alberta Blue Cross as well as the Laboratory Services dataset from Alberta Health Services. The index date will be the first diagnostic code date (or laboratory test date for patients with CKD) within the case ascertainment period. Two years of retrospective data (from April 1, 2008) will be requested such that incident cases can be be identified. The study will provide evidence for the burden of disease and inform patient management for CKD, T2DM and T2DM/CKD in Alberta.\n",

            "study_description Constipation is a frequent medical problem and affects, depending on methodological and geographic differences, up to 28% of the general population. Epidemiological studies showed that the prevalence of constipation increases with age, is higher in women compared to men and severity as well as time course are very variable. Likewise are the correlating effects on quality of life and well-being variable. Drug induced constipation (DIC) is one of the most frequent adverse reactions and a frequent reason for (co-)morbidity in otherwise healthy persons as well as in pain patients in all parts of the world. Reports on DIC in pain patients largely address opioid-induced constipation (OIC) as one aspect of opioid-induced bowel dysfunction. However, DIC also occurs in response to non-opioid analgesics and pain related co-medication such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antidepressants (ADDs), anticonvulsants (AEDs)and others. Furthermore, recent studies in elderly non-pain patients reported a correlation between occurrence and severity of constipation and the overall number of drugs used. This raises questions on a potential impact of analgesic polypharmacy on the prevalence and the biopsychosocial consequences of constipation in patients with chronic nonmalignant pain (NMP), who frequently receive a polymedication with or without opioid analgesics. To gain further insight into the prevalence and biopsychosocial consequences of DIC in patients with NMP we evaluated anonymized real-world data derived from routine medical care in pain centers within the German Pain e-Registry (GPeR), a national web-based registry developed in cooperation with the German Pain Association (Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Schmerzmedizin) and the German Pain League (Deutsche Schmerzliga).\n",

Selective prescribing according to patient characteristics, known as channeling, can lead to bias in comparative studies where drugs with similar therapeutic indications are prescribed to groups of patients with prognostic differences. Claimed advantages of a new drug may be distorted if they are channeled to patients with special pre-existing morbidity, with the consequence that disease states can be incorrectly attributed to use of the drug.

            "study_description In European studies, association between socio-economic indicators of precariousness and benzodiazepines misuse, or antidepressants has been found, but these studies targeted more specifically the adults. Some French studies dealing with mental health management of children were not specifically assessing the link between socioeconomic position (SEP) and psychotropic drugs use and/or adequacy as a primary objective, or SEP was not measured with an indicator specl. We assume that lower SEP is associated with an inadequacy to the recommendation of psychotropic drugs use among children and adolescent, regarding recommendations. Lower SEP should be associated with a greater number of benzodiazepines and antidepressants dispensing, at an individual level. Primary objective: To assess correlation between the number of benzodiazepines dispensing (anxiolytic and hypnotic drugs) and the European Deprivation Index (EDI).  Cross-sectional population-based study, based on secondary data collection, from the joint use of the Health Insurance information system and a social deprivation index in the large French region of Midi-Pyrenees during the year 2012 will be performed. Persons, aged below 18, with the right to access, as of 31 December 2012, one of the three main health insurance schemes in the Midi-Pyr√©n√©es region of France will be included. It represents 540,295 individuals who are below 18 in the exhaustive regional database that included 2,574,310 individuals (after excluding 92,542 beneficiaries who died during the period of interest and 41,349 beneficiaries to whom no IRIS could be allocated) We will perform a comparative analyses between groups, an -\tUnivariate analyses and multivariate analyses (linear regression) of the association between the number of benzodiazepines drugs dispensed and covariates.

            "study_description Since the COVID-19 epidemic was introduced in Denmark, measures have been taken to contain the spread and fight the disease. Studies from China and Italy describe that risk of severe or fatal COVID-19 disease increase with age, male sex and certain comorbid disease. The observed risk varied in the populations implying that the results are not necessarily transferable to other countries. This poses a great need to confirm known risk factors and identify unknown risk factors in a Danish population.  Concern has been raised regarding antihypertensives and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) via their suspected upregulation of ACE-2 receptors, but international recommendations have not yet been modified due to limited scientific evidence. Other medications possibly related to the host‚Äôs susceptibility to pneumonia include proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) that reduce the protective stomach acid production.   Proton pump inhibitors have previously been associated with increased risk of infection in a meta-analysis from 2015 which showed that the risk of acquiring pneumonia and being admitted to hospital due to pneumonia was increased in persons receiving PPI.   This study is a Danish nationwide registry-based study. We aim to examine the association between current use of PPI and risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 (in a case-control design) and risk of hospitalisation, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit admission and death among patients with confirmed COVID-19 (in a cohort design), respectively. All individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 will be followed from the date of positive test until hospital admission, date of death, or for up to 90 days.   Current use of PPI is defined as redeemed prescription for PPI within the prior 90 days. Odds ratios will be estimated for both the primary outcome (hospital admission) and the secondary outcome (SARS-CoV-2 infection, severe outcomes).\n",

            "study_description Antipsychotics are widely prescribed in the French general population. They constitute a heterogeneous pharmacological class, are non-selective, and each antipsychotic binds differently to Œ±1-adrenergic or serotonin 5-HT1A receptors.  Cardiovascular adverse effects are a major cause of mortality in patients exposed to antipsychotics, including ischaemic strokes within the first few weeks of prescription. These could be explained by early cardiovascular pharmacodynamic effects (orthostatic hypotension, QT prolongation). However, another class of drugs presents an increased risk of early strokes, particularly ischaemic strokes: alpha-blockers. These drugs act by strongly blocking Œ±1-adrenergic and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors. Moreover, activation of these receptors in the cerebral arteries can lead to vasoconstriction. Blocking these receptors could therefore lead to vasodilatation, resulting in cerebral hypoperfusion which could favour the occurrence of ischaemic stroke. To date and to to our knowledge, only two studies have investigated the risk of early ischemic stroke associated with antipsychotic drugs in relation to these two receptors, but they are inconsistent and have several limitations. We hypothesise that antipsychotic drugs with 5-HT1A antagonism and strong Œ±1-adrenergic antagonism are associated with a greater risk of hospitalisation for cerebral ischaemic events.  The primary objective of our study is to evaluate whether prescribing antipsychotic drugs with strong Œ±1-blocking affinity and 5-HT1A antagonist activity is associated with an increased risk of hospitalisation for ischaemic stroke or TIA within one year of initiation, compared with prescribing antipsychotic drugs with low Œ±1-adrenergic affinity and no 5-HT1A antagonism (reference group). The secondary objective of our study is to assess the possible risk factors for ischaemic stroke or TIA hospitalisations associated with incident prescribing of these two groups of antipsychotics.\n",

Ropinirole is non-ergot DA indicated for the treatment of PD. The immediate release formulation was approved over 15 years ago, a prolonged release formulation (ropinirole-PR) was more recently licensed in 2008. The proposed study is part of a post-marketing commitment to the MHRA to evaluate long term safety of ropinirole-PR. Specifically, it is proposed to estimate the incidence of dyskinesias, on-off phenomena (subject to feasibility) and impulse control disorders, in PD patients initiating ropinirole-PR monotherapy vs. initiators of immediate release DA monotherapy. This retrospective observational study will use longitudinal electronic medical records (EMR) from the UK- Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) supplemented with GP questionnaire data. Treatment persistence, adherence off-label use of ropinirole-PR will be also be evaluated. A propensity matched cohort design with adjustments for time varying covariates will be used.\n",

The incidence of melanoma among pregnant women is expected to continue to increase, as it has done in recent decades. Evidence suggests that pregnant women with melanoma have no worse a prognosis than non-pregnant women with melanoma, and that maternal and birth outcomes may be quite good depending upon the stage of disease.

            "study_description Emerging evidence from the COVID-19 pandemic suggest that patients with type 2 diabetes comprise a significant portion of the affected population and are at higher risk for severe outcomes including hospitalization and death, yet it remains largely unknown how pre-morbid medication may impact outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with type 2 diabetes. Several medications have biologically plausible mechanisms with relevance for patients with diabetes among others including ACE inhibitors, metformin, and DPP4-inhibitors. Recent large cardiovascular outcome trials and subsequent metanalyses have demonstrated that some glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and sodium-glucose-linked cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) are associated with a reduction of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality among the same high-risk populations who show higher susceptibility to severe COVID-19 and increased mortality. Yet, no studies have examined the class effect of these newer anti-hyperglycemic of mortality and other outcomes in the setting of COVID-19 infection. These data are critical because therapeutics represent a highly actionable intervention point to improve outcomes from both the inpatient and outpatient setting for a large population of patients with inherently high risk for COVID-19 associated mortality. To address this gap and inform evolving care guidelines for patients with medication-managed type 2 diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study aims to characterize the association of use of GLP1-RA and SLGT2i with COVID-19 outcomes using real world data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C). We will consider the well-studied and commonly used class of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) as the active comparator drug to avoid confounding by indication.\n",

As hypo- and hyperthyroidism are quite common conditions any association with risk and prognosis of COVID-19 may have important public health impact. Thus, there is an urgent need to clarify whether there is an increased risk and/or worsened prognosis of COVID-19 in patients with hypo- or hyperthyroidism, using high quality population-based data. Objective: To examine the risk and course of COVID-19 in patients with hypo- and hyperthyroidism.  Exposure: Hypo- and hyperthyroidism are defined as use of Levothyroxine and anti-thyroid drugs, respectively. Outcomes: Primary outcomes are death, hospitalization, intensive care unit admission within 30 days after a positive test for COVID-19. The secondary outcome is risk of COVID-19 in patients with hypo- or hyperthyroidism. Methods: Nationwide register based study including all persons tested for COVID-19 in Denmark (1.417.864, mid August 2020). The impact of hypo- and hyperthyroidism on risk of acquiring COVID-19 will be examined using a case-control design, while the prognosis will be evaluated in a cohort of COVID-19 positive patients. The odds ratio for hypo- and hyperthyroidism will be estimated using logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender, and comorbidity.\n",

            "study_description Beyond the psycho-social consequences of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, people with severe mental disorders, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder have been reported with an up to 2-fold increased 30-days risk of death after a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) positive test. Recent use of psychotropic agents has also been associated with increased risk of death, varying between 50% in users of antidepressants to a three-fold increase in users of antipsychotics. The importance of maintaining and adjusting pharmacological treatment of people with severe mental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic has been emphasized. Identifying those drugs with lower risk profiles regarding adverse outcomes to COVID-19 will support guidance of selecting and adjusting acute and maintenance treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The present study aims at providing a population-based description of the association and potential differential impact of frequently used psychotropic drugs on the course and outcomes of COVID-19 in people with hospital diagnosed and without hospital diagnosed psychiatric disorders. We hypothesize that psychotropic treatment patterns differ between community-treated COVID-19 patients and hospitalized or deceased COVID-19 patients with lower risks for unfavourable outcomes in users of a) aripiprazole, haloperidol, risperidone or paliperidone as oral or short-acting injectable antipsychotics vs. other oral or depot long-acting antipsychotics, b) short-acting benzodiazepines vs. long-acting benzodiazepines, c) SSRIs vs. tricyclic antidepressants. We will use data from the prospectively collected Danish COVID-19 cohort at Statens Serum Institut including all Danish residents tested by the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2.\n",

            "study_description This study aims to provide an accurate tool that allows patients to be classified \"a priori\" according to their probability of success in responding to one of the immunosuppressive biological drugs that are currently being administered to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, Tocilizumab. Tocilizumab is an interleukin-6 (IL-6) cell receptor blocker, which has been shown to be effective in fighting SARS-CoV-2 infection in different pre-clinical studies and is currently indicated for prescription in patients with a moderate level of severity of lung involvement. Likewise, different cynical trials have been initiated, in China (ChiCTR2000029765) and Italy, in patients with pneumonia and early respiratory failure (Favalli et al. 2020, PMID: 32205186).With the recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, different lines of research have shown that, more than the virus itself, what really aggravates the situation of infected patients, is the \"cytokine storm\" (Prompetchara et al. 2020, PMID: 32105090). This phenomenon, which can lead to the onset of viral sepsis, inflammation-induced lung damage, and even death, it results from dysregulation of the patient's immune system when trying to fight the virus. This \"cytokine storm\" is made up of very high levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as Interleukin-1Œ≤ (IL-1Œ≤), IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor-Œ± ( TNF-Œ±) and chemokines such as CXCL10 or CCL2 among others, together with a significant degree of lymphopenia and a drastic decrease in Interferon (IFN) (Favalli et al. 2020, PMID: 32205186). Specifically, the increase in IL-6 associated with severe pneumonia can have deleterious effects on the adaptive immune response (sarzi-Puttini et al. 2020, PMID: 32202240).\n",

            "study_description Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a heart condition that increases the risk of stroke. Blood thinning tablets known as oral anticoagulants (OACs) help to reduce the risk of stroke and guidelines recommend that OACs are prescribed to people with AF who also have other risk factors for stroke such as heart failure, high blood pressure or diabetes.  Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), such as warfarin, were the only OACs available. VKAs are difficult to manage as they require frequent blood tests and regular dose changes, they also interact with lots of other medicines and food. Historically, VKAs have been under-used in older people due to concerns about patients managing the complex dosing schedule if they have cognitive impairment, and also the risk of brain bleeds if they fall. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) were introduced as an alternative to VKAs in 2008 but were not licensed for stroke prevention in AF until 2011. It is not known whether the introduction of DOACs has changed the rates of OAC prescribing for older people (aged 75 years and over) or how patient demographics, other medical conditions and concomitant prescribing affect the choice of OAC prescribed in UK general practice.  The objectives of the study are: 1. To describe changes in the point prevalence and incidence of OAC prescribing by year prior to the introduction of DOACs (2003-2007), between the introduction of DOACs and the time they were recommended as an option by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Care Excellence (NICE) for stroke prevention in AF (2008-2012), and following publication of NICE technology appraisals recommending DOACs (2013-2017). 2. To describe switching between OACs during the study period. 3. To compare the characteristics of patients with AF who were newly started on OACs during each period described in objective 1, to those not prescribed an OAC in the same period. 4. To describe persistence with DOACs compared with warfarin.\n",

LEMS is estimated to affect 1 in 100,000 people in the European Community and is clinically characterized by weakness and frequent fatigue (mainly of the legs and trunk), and is associated with autonomic dysfunction (e.g. impotence, dry mouth, constipation). The onset of symptoms is usually gradual and insidious. The age at onset is typically ‚â• 40 years in patients with cancer and between 20 and 50 years in those without. Slightly more men than women are affected. LEMS has also been reported in children, sometimes associated with neuroblastoma, but is an extremely rare condition in this patient group.  In January 2010 the EU approved the Marketing Authorisation of 3, 4-DAP Phosphate (Amifamdripine, Firdapse¬Æ) for the treatment of LEMS. Firdapse is the only approved 3, 4-DAP compound for the treatment of LEMS.  The purpose of the LEMS registry is to collect additional data on the long term safety and efficacy of Firdapse for patients who have been prescribed Firdapse by their treating physician. This registry will also increase knowledge about the course of disease in patients with LEMS by evaluating neurological and muscular function.  The LEMS registry is a voluntary multi-centre, multinational, observational program for patients with LEMS disease, intended to track the routine clinical outcomes of patients with LEMS over time. As per condition of the EU Marketing Authorisation, the registry will also track the use of treatment for LEMS including drugs other than Firdapse. The data collected by the registry are intended to enable better characterisation of the natural history of LEMS.All patients with a confirmed diagnosis of LEMS disease may be eligible to participate in this program.

Tools developed for the analysis of spontaneous reports, however, were not specifically aimed at the analysis of safety information related to pregnancy. As a first step, this demonstration study will aim to gain insight into the nature of information on drug exposure during pregnancy from spontaneous reports and literature reports as filed in the ICSR databases of national PV centres and Marketing Authorisation Holders. The category literature reports therefore encompass Individual Case Safety Reports originating from published case series, non-interventional studies and Patient Support Programmes.  In order to achieve this general aim, 5 sub-studies have been designed. The first sub-study aims to describe the nature and content of spontaneous reports and literature data sources. The second sub-study aims to create and validate a dedicated assessment tool for measuring the clinical quality of pregnancy data specifically, and the third sub-study aims to use this newly developed tool in order to describe the quality of reports in spontaneous reports and literature. Sub-study 4 will assess predictors of currently used teratogen signal detection techniques in ICSR databases and sub-study 5 aims to explore cluster analysis as a possible new teratogen signal detection technique.\n",

The European Medicines Agency, and other major institutions and societies, have called for research and issued warnings against ACE-I/ARB discontinuation in patients with COVID-19, as drug discontinuation may worsen underlying cardiometabolic conditions. As ACE-I/ARB are widely used drugs, any association with risk and prognosis may have public health impact. Thus, there is an urgent need to clarify the hypothesis of any increased risk for COVID-19 or worsened prognosis for adverse outcomes of COVID-19. The primary aim of the study is to examine the association between ACE-I/ARB use and risk of death in patients with COVID-19. The secondary aim is to examine the association of ACE-I/ARB use with risk of hospital admission, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and renal replacement therapy. The third aim is to examine the risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19 among all patients referred to SARS-CoV-2 testing.  This nationwide study will include all patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 in Denmark. By individual-level linkage of Danish registries, the impact of ACE-I/ARB on risk of COVID-19 will be examined using a test-negative case-control design, while the prognosis with regard to mortality and intensive care admission will be examined in a cohort design of test-positive COVID-19 patients.\n",

            "study_description Febrile neutropenia (FN) following myelosuppressive chemotherapy is a potentially life-threatening complication and is associated with loss of treatment efficacy because of dose delays, and dose reductions. To prevent FN, the National Comprehensive Care Network (NCCN) guidelines recommends prophylactic use of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for patients receiving a chemotherapy regimen associated with high risk of developing FN (‚â• 20%) or those receiving regimens with intermediate-risk of FN (10-20%) and have at least one patient-level risk factor. Pegfilgrastim is a long-acting G-CSF that is administered once per cycle and is the most commonly used G-CSF in the US. The US prescribing information for pegfilgrastim specifies that Neulasta should not be administered in the period between 14 days before and 24 hours after administration of myelosuppressive chemotherapy. This restriction was placed because of the potential for an increase in sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells stimulated by pegfilgrastim to myelosuppressive chemotherapy. However, this restriction precludes the prophylactic use of pegfilgrastim among several Q2W chemotherapy regimens associated with high or intermediate risk for FN. The European label for pegfilgrastim does not include the 14-day exclusion period for Neulasta prior to chemotherapy, only exclusion in the 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy is administered. The latest NCCN guidelines recommend that there should be at least 12 days between the dose of pegfilgrastim and the next cycle of chemotherapy supporting the use of prophylactic pegfilgrastim in patients receiving Q2W regimens. This is consistent with the guidelines of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC). The objective of this review is to provide a single-source information for oncologists and payers to make evidence-based decisions.\n",

The aims are 1) to describe the prescriptive patterns of drugs used for the treatment of patients affected by RND and identify patient characteristics associated to these patterns in the three Italian regions (Tuscany, Umbria, Lazio), accounting for over 10 million residents, and 2) to perform a comparative evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of drugs used for the treatment of RND, with a focus on specific active agents. The study population will be enrolled in the period 2009-2019, with a two-year look-back and at least 1 year of follow-up, including patients, resident in one of the three regions and affected by Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Progressive muscular atrophy (PMA), Pseudobulbar palsy, Progressive bulbar palsy (PBP), Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), Other motor neuron disease, Myasthenia gravis (MG). Patients will be defined from Hospital discharge records (ICD-9-CM codes), disease specific copayment exemptions, and, as far as possible, disease specific drug treatments. Drug utilisation patterns will be based on drugs (ATC codes) prescribed to outpatients using the DDDs. Safety and effectiveness will be investigated using a new-user approach and applying both, intention-to-treat and as-treated analysis. Clinical data available in two of the participating regions for ALS patients will be used to 1) validate the algorithm used for patient identification, 2) validate the exposure definition, and 3) perform external adjustment. Data and analysis ill be managed through a common data model, with shared data scripts, performing the analysis at regional level (in-house) and pooling aggregated anonymous data to obtain overall results.\n",

            "study_description With the cancellation of the Eperzan EU MA in January 2019, this post marketing study is no longer required or feasible to conduct. This study is a nested case control study and uses the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) of the U.K. The diabetes cohort will include type 2 diabetic subjects aged ‚â• 18 years old who are ‚Äúnew users‚Äù of an antidiabetic agent (ADA) as of when albiglutide is fully launched in the UK. The study compares the risk of malignant neoplasms of special interest (thyroid and pancreatic cancer) in subjects prescribed albiglutide, and albiglutide in combination with insulin, to other antidiabetic agent and insulin, respectively. It also compares the risk of the most common malignant neoplams in subjects prescribed albiglutide in combination with insulin compared to insulin. Analysis will be conducted when approximately 10,000 albiglutide prescribed subjects, with a minimum follow-up duration of one year each, have accrued in the database. Conditional logistic regression will be used to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the malignant neoplasms of special interest and the common malignant neoplasms associated with the use of albiglutide compared to other antidiabetic agents.\n",

            "study_description Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease with serious, chronically debilitating morbidities and high premature mortality, and at present, there is no cure. Cystic fibrosis affects approximately 70,000 individuals worldwide and is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR), which result in absent or deficient function of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein at the cell surface.Ivacaftor (Kalydeco‚Ñ¢, 150-mg tablets) has been approved in the United States, the European Union (EU), Canada and Australia to date, for the treatment of CF in patients 6 years of age and older who have a G551D mutation in the CFTR gene. Ivacaftor is an orally bioavailable small molecule CFTR potentiator that targets the underlying defect in CF. As such, ivacaftor is a member of a new class of drugs - CFTR modulators - that provide a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of CF. Ivacaftor is the first CFTR modulator to show an improvement in CFTR function and clinical benefit in patients with CF.Ivacaftor is intended for chronic, potentially lifelong use. Understanding of the long term effects will be informative to patients and their parents, prescribers, and payers. Existing CF registries provide an established source to obtain long term safety in a real life use for analysis. The patient registries of the CF Trust in the United Kingdom (UK) and the CF Foundation in the United States (US) provide the ideal source to obtain long term safety information because the data collected are extensive and consistent with one another. In addition, the patients with CF from the CF Trust and the CF Foundation patient registries encompass a majority of the patients in the indicated population.Cystic fibrosis patient registries from France and Ireland were considered for this study and will be used for drug utilization analysis.\n",

            "study_description The proposed study will include clinical characterization and population-level effect estimation (observational causal inference) of men with castrate resistant prostate cancer using administrative claims databases which include nation-wide samples of patients insured in the United States (US). We plan to conduct a new user comparative cohort design to compare incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke among men with castrate resistant prostate cancer who are initiating treatment with either abiraterone acetate plus prednisone or enzalutamide. The study period will begin after August 31, 2012 since before that date enzalutamide was not FDA-approved for the treatment of CRPC in the US. Following completion of a feasibility analysis in which we will assess diagnostics to see whether comparisons between abiraterone and enzalutamide are possible, we will compare incidence of various outcomes including ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, heart failure, and acute myocardial infarction. Patients within each treatment cohort will be described including demographics, conditions, drugs, and procedures used in the time preceding the index date. For calculation of incidence rates, the number of persons with each event, the incidence proportion, and the incidence rate adjusted for person-time according to each at-risk time window for each study population and each of the outcomes of interest will be reported. For the purpose of contextualizing the event rates and quantifying relative risk while controlling for additional confounding factors, a new user cohort design will be used to conduct comparative analyses if the exposed (abiraterone) population can be appropriately matched to the selected comparator population (enzalutamide) based on a defined set of patient and clinical characteristics, using propensity score matching. Cox proportional hazards will be used to estimate the hazards of each outcome in the target cohort, relative to the comparator cohort.\n",

These treatment delays occur in over 10% of chemotherapy patients and cause both patient and service inconvenience. The aim of this research is to develop a prediction model to understand those patients most susceptible to dose delays, enabling clinicians to action any mitigation strategies. This study is a retrospective cohort study using chemotherapy prescribing data from 4 UK hospitals to develop and internally validate a risk prediction model. Predictor variables have been identified from the literature. These will be initially analysed by univariable analysis to understand their associations with outcome, dose delays. These variables will enable the development of a multivariable logistic regression model. The model will be tested for performance and internally validated.\n",

            "study_description Background: There has been speculation that drugs used to manage chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension could lead to increased risk of both COVID-19 infection and deaths related to the infection. On the other hand there is also belief that some medications may be protective (e.g. HCQ). This has been amplified on social media and there is no current evidence to support these hypotheses. In order to provide appropriate guidance for these high risk patients, it is essential that we conduct a pharmaco-epidemiological study to investigate these effects.Aim: This study will aim to identify the effect of current use of various antihypertensive treatments (ACE inhibitors, ARAs and calcium channel blockers), therapies for type 2 diabetes (SGLT2 inhibitors), NSAIDs and hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19 infection rates and related mortality. We will compare the rates and severity (hospitalisation due to COVID-19, mortality) of COVID-19 infection among patients prescribed with the above-mentioned drugs (with an underlying condition indicating a necessity for their prescription) compared to propensity score matched patients prescribed with comparator drugs (with the same underlying condition). Design: Propensity score matched cohort study with active comparators. Target population: Adults aged 50 years and above with a diagnosis of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis as of 30th Jan 2020.

            "study_description The overall objective of this project is to address novel research questions using comprehensive registry data in a large, national Finnish birth cohort on the relationship between use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications during pregnancy and psychiatric disorders from birth to age 21. The safety of SSRIs during pregnancy is a question of clear importance to patients and clinicians. The prevalence of major depression in pregnancy is 5-10%, and as many as 20% of pregnant women experience depressive symptoms. Gestational SSRI use has also been increasing in other countries, including Finland, where the proportion of pregnant women purchasing antidepressants increased significantly from 1996 to 2010. Given the particularly high prevalence of depression in women and the increasing use of SSRIs, more research is needed to investigate potential short- and long-term harms to the fetus. Only recently have studies attempted to investigate this issue in population-based birth cohorts. We have previously investigated relationships between maternal SSRIs and several neuropsychiatric outcomes, including depression, anxiety, autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and speech/language disorders until 14 years‚Äô age. We shall extend the follow up until age 21, which will permit us to examine the risk trajectory of the previously observed increased risk of depression following maternal SSRI exposure and will markedly increase the sample size. The additional 7 years of follow-up, through adolescence and early adulthood, will permit us to examine whether the sharp rise in risk of the previously observed offspring depression continues into these age groups. This will also allow us to augment the sample of maternal SSRI-exposed subjects, for a total of estimated ~29,000 children born from 1996-2016.\n",

The available information on the evolution, complications, responses to different treatments of patients with inherited heart diseases is extremely scarce. Certain commonly used drugs for these conditions may have an impact on the clinical course of the infection (ACE inhibitors or ARBs). Some antiviral drugs used in the treatment of Covid-19 alter the QT interval and facilitate the onset of arrhythmias. Direct infection of Covid-19 in the myocardium has been reported. The main objective is to describe the clinical course of Covid-19 infection in patients previously diagnosed with an inherited cardiac condition. The secondary objectives are: (1) to assess the relation between previous chronic treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs and the severity of Covid-19 infection, and (2) to assess the impact of established antiviral treatments on cardiac disease (heart function, ECG changes, arrhythmias and cardiac complications).Methods: The inclusion criteria are: patients with confirmed Covid-19 infection previously diagnosed with any of the following inherited cardiac diseases: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy, non-compaction cardiomyopathy, long or short QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome or catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.Participants have to provide informed consent.

            "study_description In the course of the current pandemic caused by the spread and replication of SARS-Cov-2, respiratory symptoms dominate the clinical picture of the disease. However, a significant percentage of patients with COVID-19 infection present with gastrointestinal symptoms, such as anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, which are not always associated with respiratory symptoms or clinics. This percentage, according to current medical literature, ranges from 34% to 60%. Our study wants to focus basically on patients whose main symptom is diarrhea and because of their characteristics of fragility and associated comorbidities are not candidates for referral to acute hospital or aggressive therapies. Bismuth colloidal compounds such as bismuth subsalicylate are antidiarrheal drugs whose mechanism of action is combined: on the one hand, it stimulates the absorption of fluids and electrolytes through the intestinal wall by inhibiting the secretion of chloride, and on the other hand, when hydrolyzed to salicylic acid, it inhibits the synthesis of prostaglandins responsible for intestinal inflammation and hypermotility. Its action is anti-secretory and antimicrobial.In the context of the SARS-CoV-2 infection pandemic, a prioritization of the use of health resources is established. This implies that frail, elderly patients with chronic diseases who, in addition, are often admitted to centres with a high incidence of COVID-19, do not have access to mechanical ventilation, and therefore have even higher mortality. Diarrhea is a major problem in these patients so we have designed a prospective study in which the main objective is to determine the efficacy of bismuth subcitrate treatment in COVID-19 patients with acute diarrhea.Main objective:To determine the efficacy of bismuth subcitrate in the treatment of diarrhea as the main symptom of COVID 19 disease, in the group of fragile patients with associated comorbidities and not candidates for invasive therapy\n",

            "study_description Epidemiologic characteristics suggest that 14% cases affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are severe, and 5% critical. Management of severe COVID-19 patients is consistent with that provided to patients with viral pneumonia causing respiratory failure and includes lung-protective ventilation strategies and possible mechanical ventilation. Whereas there is significant experience in treatment of severe acute respiratory failure (SARF), the risk factors for SARF are not well characterized. A recent study looked at a composite value of 5 variables (age, dehydration, respiratory failure, orientation, blood pressure) to predict risk for mortality and requirement for mechanical ventilation. This relatively small study was followed by a few studies evaluating risk factors for pneumonia. However, we are not aware of any large population-based study designed to identify risk factors for SARF and/or need for mechanical ventilation. This study is therefore design to identify key patient variables, known at time of admission, as well as medication and procedure use during hospitalization, that may predict risk for need for mechanical ventilation and mortality.The rationale for conducting this study is as follows: due to the potentially large COVID-19 population requiring ventilation support, there is a risk that the US healthcare system might be overwhelmed.

            "study_description The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has reported symptoms as fever, cough, fatigue headache, pneumonia, diarrhea, hemoptysis and dyspnea.1 Pneumonia and consequences thereof are fatal to many of the critically-ill patients. 2Whereas multiple papers have attempted to describe the radiographic differences between COVID-19 pneumonia and other viral pneumonias, differentiating between viral pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia at patient admission is difficult, even for experienced physicians, yet alone differentiating between COVID-19 viral and all other viral pneumonias. 3 4 Large-scale analysis to evaluate patient comorbidities, demographics and risk factors for viral pneumonia, as compared to other pneumonia types, has not been well documented. This study is designed to further our understanding of viral pneumonia to help healthcare systems deal with the COVID-19 pandemic.The rationale for conducting this study is as follows: due to the potentially large COVID-19 population requiring ventilation support, there is a risk that the US healthcare system might be overwhelmed. Models to help understand patients at greater risk for increased healthcare needs or mortality may thus help with policy planning, decisions and treatment.This study will be conducted using the Mercy Electronic Healthcare Data - This data is uniquely fit for purpose as it contains, among other common variables, information such as spirometry data, detailed vitals, exact time when ventilator use is ordered and started.\n",

            "study_description The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 uses the protein ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) as the receptor binding domain for its protein S (spike) to gain entry into cells and replicate. Blockers of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have been reported to upregulate the expression of ACE2 and this observation has raised the hypothesis that the use of these drugs could facilitate COVID-19 infection and/or make it more serious. Yet, the epidemiological evidence is lacking. The aim of this project is to carry out a quick case-population study using patients admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19 as cases and a random sample of patients from a primary care database as the control series matched with cases for exact age, sex, and month-day (10 controls per case). Information on comorbidities and drugs used in the last month (current use) will be extracted from the clinical records in both cases and controls. We will examine the association of COVID-19 with the current use of RAS blockers as compared to non-use and as compared to current use of other antihypertensive drugs by computing the adjusted Odds Ratio through a conditional logistic regression model. The feasibility of selecting a secondary series of COVID-19+ cases who were not admitted to hospital (milder cases) will be assessed.\n",

The aim of this systematic review is to provide an overview of the available observational studies looking at the association between maternal paracetamol exposure during pregnancy and the risk of neurodevelopment disorders and urogenital system disorders in offspring. The review focuses on the methodology used in these observational studies and whether additional comparisons and reference groups have been used to evaluate the associations and the type of confounders that have been included in existing analyses. This approach follows that used in a recent publication assessing studies measuring the association between antidepressant exposure during pregnancy and risk of autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in offspring. The use of different comparator or reference groups in this publication provided supportive evidence examining whether statistically significant associations observed comparing risk in exposed women to risk in all unexposed women subject to confounding by indication was more or less likely to be causal 1.This review aims to provide some insight to whether the existing studies provide sufficient information to help determine whether the associations between maternal paracetamol exposure during pregnancy and the risk of neurodevelopment disorders and urogenital system disorders in offspring are likely to be causal, and to help make recommendations for or how to potentially address these challenges in further studies.\n",

Monoclonal antibodies against proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) have been shown to result in LDL-C lowering and CVD risk reduction. This relatively new class of drugs has not been widely studied in daily clinic, and anecdotal evidence has suggested that a small proportion of patients do either not respond to this medication or suffer from side effects.Objective: To describe the characteristics of patients with either low PCSK9 inhibitor therapy efficacy or adverse effects, based on the interpretation of the treating physician.Study design: Multi-center case-control studyStudy population: 20 subjects in whom PCSK9 inhibitor therapy has been shown to result less than 30 percent reduction in LDL-C as assessed by the referring physician, and 20 subjects in whom PCSK9 inhibitor therapy was discontinued due to adverse effects will be compared with 40 controls in whom PCSK9 inhibitor therapy is considered to be successful.Main study parameters/endpoints: This is a descriptive study in which we will assess differences in clinical parameters (e.g., patient anthropometrics between patients and controls, and identify possible (novel) mutations in the PCSK9 gene possibly interfering with PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, variants in other lipid metabolism or PCSK9 related genes, assess gene expression, (semi)quantification of proteins (PCSK9 protein, other proteins involved in lipid metabolism, proteomics), PCSK9 antibody concentrations, antidrug antibodies, and (semi-) quantification of metabolites (e.g. lipids/fatty acids).\n",

            "study_description Exploring and combining results from more than one real world data (RWD) source might be necessary in order to explore variability and demonstrate generalisability of the results, or for regulatory requirements. However, the heterogeneous nature of RWD poses challenges when working with more than one source, some of which can be solved by analysing databases converted into a common data model (CDM).The main objective of the study was to evaluate the implementation of the Observational Medical Outcome Partnership (OMOP) CDM on IQVIA Medical Research Data (IMRD) UK data. A drug utilisation study describing the prescribing of codeine for pain in children was used as a case study to be replicated in IMRD-UK and its corresponding OMOP CDM transformation. Differences between IMRD-UK source and OMOP CDM were identified and investigated.\n",

P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) are the two important efflux transporter proteins in the human placenta. It is not known if drug transporter protein -mediated drug interactions account for the possible teratogenicity of drugs or if such interactions can also predispose to neonatal drug toxicity.Objectives. To investigate if concomitant use of two or more drug transporter substrates or a substrate and an inhibitor during first trimester is associated with an increased risk of offspring major congenital malformations. Specifically, we will assess the risk of overall malformations in offspring of women using SGAs, and the risk of cardiac malformations in offspring of women using SSRIs or bupropion, and the risk of severe or prolonged neonatal adaptation problems.Methods. This is a population-based cohort study based on the Drugs and Pregnancy project database in Finland. Data are derived from national health registers: the Medical Birth Register, the Register on Induced Abortions, the Malformation Register and the Prescription Register and Special Refund Entitlement Register. Data in these registers have been collected during Jan 1st 1996 - Dec 31st 2011 and include all births (live and still births), pregnancy terminations due to major congenital malformation, and information on drug purchases during pregnancy and 3 months before pregnancy. To this database we will further link data on individual drugs and their relation (substrate, inhibitor) to P-gp and BCRP from the University of Washington Metabolism and Transport Drug Interaction Database (DIDB). Offspring of women with concomitant use of two or more drug transporter substrates, or a combination of a substrate and an inhibitor, are compared to offspring of women using only one drug transporter specific substrate, and to unexposed.\n",

Our study aims to provide a detailed evaluation of melanoma survival over time in England. As previous studies have shown that melanoma survival varies significantly according to patient demographic characteristics, and particularly socioeconomic status we will also evaluate whether any observed changes over time vary within different subgroups, specifically disease stage and SES. Patients aged 18 years and above who are diagnosed with malignant melanoma of any stage from 1 January 1985 to 31 December 2015 will be identified from English Cancer Registry data held by Public Health England (PHE). The study period will span from 1 January 1985 until the latest available data (currently projected to be 31 December 2016). We will use the existing cancer registration data from PHE. The cancer registration dataset includes data on demographics, characteristics of the tumour, patients‚Äô vitality status and basic information regarding the treatment received.We will analyse the data to describe patient characteristics and calculate time to death. We will also calculate a measure called ‚Äòrelative survival‚Äô, which is an estimate of how the survival among cancer patients compares to that in the general population. This is valuable because not all patients who die may die due to their cancer, and this statistictakes that into account.\n",

            "study_description Endometriosis is a common, chronic, gynecological disease characterized by pain and imparied fertility. The proportion of premenopausal women with endometriosis is approximately 10%. Symptoms seem to repond to decreased circulating estrogen and the mainstay of medical treatment is hormonal induced anovulation and a reduction in endogenous estrogen production.Dienogest (DNG) is a progestogen that is highly selective for progesterone receptors. It has been available as part of a combined oral contraceptive containing 2mg DNG and 30mcg of ethinylestradiol in Germany since 1995. As a monotherapy for endometriosis treatment DNG 2mg/day has been available in Japan since 2008 where it has been found to be a reliable and effective treatment for symptoms associated with endometriosis.Two well-known class effects of progestogens are the induction of bleeding disturbances and mood disturbances. Bleeding disturbances are a common symptom of endometriosis and it is not known what influence DNG will have on bleeding disturbances associated with endometriosis. In addition, women who suffer from endometriosis are at high risk of developing depression. The complexities and potential interaction between depresion, endometriosis and progestogens make it difficult to differentiate whether a woman's symptoms are causally associated with progestin use. A population-based post-authorization safety study (PASS) is needed to assess the potential influence of DNG on mood disturbances in endometriosis patients.The VIPOS study will have a similar study design to the EURAS/INAS study design. This has been shown to be a suitable study design for monitoring the safety of hormonal preparations under real-life user conditions.\n",

Objectives of the Initiative include facilitating the use of existing patient registries as well as the establishment of new registries if none are available or adequate. At a consultative meeting in October 2016, expert stakeholders who included registry holders, patients, health care professionals (HCPs), regulators, marketing authorisation holders and applicants (MAHs/MAAs), health technology assessment (HTA) and reimbursement bodies, and European Commission representatives participated in discussions to share their views on barriers and facilitators to registry use and on optimising the use of registries for regulatory assessments. Subsequently EMA hosted four disease-specific patient registry workshops: Cystic Fibrosis (14th June 2017), Multiple Sclerosis (7th July 2017), CAR T-cell therapy Registries (9th February 2018) and Haemophilia Registries (8th June 2018). These disease areas were chosen because there was ongoing product development with new products recently approved or undergoing assessment and registries had requested support for harmonisation. Following each workshop, a report was published that included the recommendations and actions arising. Participants, who represented all of the stakeholder groups, contributed to the drafting of the reports.During October-November 2018, a survey was conducted to assess the impact of the workshops on stakeholder registry-related activities and to identify further EMA activities that could be explored to facilitate stakeholders‚Äô work.\n",

            "study_description Aseptic loosening (AL) is a major cause of failure of total knee arthroplasty (TKA), accounting for up to 31% of all failures. A systematic review conducted by Cherian et al evaluated risk factors for AL following both TKA and total hip arthroplasty (THA) procedures. Although there were conflicting results across studies, some investigations reported that patient-related factors such as smoking and BMI were associated with AL. This study was designed to evaluate risk of AL and revision due to AL in patients with cemented TKA. A retrospective longitudinal cohort study is described herein, using data from claims and electronic health records from the US.Analyses include: Crude and adjusted cumulative incidence of AL and revision due to AL per post-index year. Survival analyses (Kaplan-Meier and weighted Cox models). Poisson regressions.Random-effect and fixed-effect models for aggregation of data from multiple databases, using DerSimonian & Laird (D.-L.) and Hartung-Knapp-Sidik-Jonkman (HKSJ) method.\n",

            "study_description Registries have shown to be an important pharmacovigilance strategy, as they provide data on non-selected populations, with long periods of follow-up and with comparison groups that allow for the calculation of meaningful risks. Previous experiences in psoriasis, including Biobadaderm (the Spanish Registry of Adverse Events Associated with Biologic Drugs in Dermatology) and Psonet (European Network of Psoriasis Registries), have shown the importance of establishing specific registers of patients treated with systemic therapies to describe long term safety of therapy.As happened with psoriasis, over the last years, new immunomodulatory drugs are been developed for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD). They all affect specific immune pathways and raise safety concerns related to all immunomodulatory drugs. Dupilumab is the first biologic that has been approved by the FDA and the EMA, for the treatment of adults with AD. We expect new drugs for AD to reach the market in the next decade, leading to an increased use of dupilumab and the progressive addition of new molecules. Considering that the prevalence of AD is high in the population and the severe impairment in the quality of life of the patients, there are many potential users. For this reason, knowing their side effects in real life use in the shortest period of time is an important public health objective. Many other outcomes can be relevant in an AD registry, including effectiveness outcomes. We will take advantage of the previous work done by the ‚ÄúHarmonising Outcome Measures for Eczema‚Äù(HOME) initiative, that has studied and described the validity of outcome measures in atopic dermatitis.The Spanish Registry of Systemic therapy in atopic eczema, BIOBADATOP, assesses drug safety and treatment effectiveness as well as treatment impact on quality of life in children and adults with atopic eczema receiving systemic immuno-modulatory therapies in Spanish daily practice.\n",

            "study_description Genital warts are a frequent sexually-transmitted disease. It has been estimated that about 5‚Äì10% of the population will have at least one episode of genital warts during their lifetime1. It has been recently described an overall annual incidence of genital warts from 160 to 289/100,000 person-years. Over 90% of genital warts are related to HPV6/11. In Europe there are three licensed vaccines containing recombinant HPV L1 capsid proteins. In the Valencian Community in Spain, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV 6/11/16/18) was used only between 2008 and 2010 and was administered in a three-dose regimen to vaccinate girls when they were 14 years old. Thereafter, the bivalent vaccine AS04-bHPV (HPV 16/18) was used. This change allowed us to perform the first analysis (to our knowledge) of the effectiveness of both HPV vaccines in preventing genital warts in the same population. In the previous population-based study the oldest vaccinated women in our cohort was 19 years old at the end of the follow up period, so we were unable to assess the vaccine impact on cervical cancer as these women did not reach the screening age. Unvaccinated girls and those vaccinated with the bivalent vaccine had the same risk of incidence of genital warts. HPV-related tumors in HIVpositive patients tend to occur at a younger age and at a more advanced stage than in HIV-negative patients. One of our objectives in the present study is to estimate the effectiveness of the HPV vaccines to prevent genital warts in women aged from 14 to 23+ (depending on the date of data extraction) years old. We also propose to assess the incidence and treatment-costs of GW in subjects aged from 14 to 65 years old. Another secondary objective is to estimate the effectiveness of the HPV vaccines to prevent genital warts in IC women aged from 14 to 23+ years old. Finally, towards future studies we aim to explore the precancerous lesions diagnoses in women aged from 14 to 65 years old.\n",

            "study_description Acute gastroenteritis is a frequent disease, with rotavirus being the main cause in children under 5 years of age. Every year, RV accounted for 231 deaths, more than 87,000 hospitalisations, and nearly 700,000 outpatient visits in Europe. In addition to the clinical impact, these rotavirus-associated events result in increased medical expenses, lost productivity, and other costs to society and families. In Spain, rotavirus vaccines have been available since 2006 (RV1) and 2007 (RV5). Benefits of rotavirus vaccines have been widely studied. These kind of studies in Spain have separately, and for varied populations and time periods, analysed vaccines impact on RVAGE-hospitalizations (up to 71% reduction in infants), all-cause AGE hospitalizations (up to 39% reduction in infants) (11) and effectiveness (over 85% effective against rotavirus hospitalization among young children). The effects of rotavirus vaccine on ED and outpatients visits are not widely documented. This study aims to provide for the first time a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of rotavirus vaccines on ED and outpatient utilization among children\n",

Among the patients with the highest risk of suffering an HZ are patients with advanced age and immunosuppression of different origin and grade. These subjects would be beyond the scope of the only vaccine that currently exists on the market, as it is a live attenuated virus vaccine. An alternative to this type of vaccine is the inactivated subunit vaccine (glycoprotein E). Primary objective: Estimate the incidence of HZ in immunosuppressed subjects ‚â• 18 years in the Valencian Community, between 2009 and 2014, both globally and stratifying by age groups, sex and type of immunodeficiency. Secondary: Estimate the risk of HZ in immunocompromised subjects compared to immunocompetent subjects, compare the consumption of health resources, the risk of complications and the risk of recurrent HZ. To study the impact of HZ on the underlying pathology (immunosuppression), comparing the six months prior to the first diagnosis of HZ with the six months after said diagnosis. To study the risk of HZ and the consumption of resources in immunocompromised patients in comorbidity with diabetes and / or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and / or heart failure and / or chronic kidney disease, compared to immunocompetent subjects.

            "study_description Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important cause of respiratory infection in children younger than 2 years and the cause of the highest number of hospitalizations. Different vaccine development programs for infant or pregnant women are in advanced stages (Phase II / III), so it is estimated that this vaccine could be a reality soon. Pharmaeconomic studies allowing the estimation of the potential impact of these vaccines are required in advance. The reference analysis for the economic-sanitary evaluation of a new health intervention is cost-utility. Their results are expressed in quality-adjusted life-year (QALY), where the utility evaluates the condition of the disease to the health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The few existing studies show that child vaccination against RSV could be cost-effective in other countries. However, they obtained useful data using other countries‚Äô QALYs literature. So far there are no available studies estimating QALYs or utilities loss due to RSV infection in children less than 2 years of age (the range of age where the incidence is higher), nor CUA of RSV vaccines candidates available in Spain. As a previous step, it is a priority to establish an estimate of the loss of HRQOL due to RSV in children younger than 2 years and their relatives, measured through utility (QALY) at the national level. This project includes a prospective, multicenter and observational study among Spanish children less than 24 months of age, recruited in different primary care centers and hospitals of Valencian Community and Catalonia, where QALYs of RSV-infected children and their parents will be evaluated through novel health utilities questionnaire and method. The study will be contribute to generate valid data for the future pharmacoeconomic analysis of the vaccine, which will be necessary for decision making and the establishment of recommendations on the use of the vaccine against RSV in Spain.\n",

            "study_description Influenza and vaccination against influenza have a profound impact on society. Thus, knowing the illness burden due to influenza and the impact of current vaccination programs is necessary to take present and future decisions. On the other hand, given the characteristics of the virus and the vaccine, this information must be generated in a timely and continuous manner, so it is convenient to study several flu seasons in large samples of the population.For this purpose, estimates of the influenza vaccine effectiveness based on information from sentinel medical networks using case-control studies or screening methods are useful.These estimates must be timely, robust and reliable, so that the parts involved can take decisions and assessing the impact of the measures adopted have useful information and quality. This need justifies the performance of phase IV post-authorization effectiveness studies based on the impact of the infection and preventive measures on hospital admissions due to influenza.In our case, it is a case-control study based on a hospital-based system of active surveillance of incident income where the presence of influenza infection is verified with the study's own resources.

            "study_description BACKGROUND: While bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for severe obesity, some research suggests that it might double the risk of bone breaks. However, the data is controversial, and most of the existing studies compare patients undergoing surgery to those not offered such treatments, making the results difficult to interpret. In addition, we do not know which patients who receive bariatric surgery are at highest risk of breaking their bone/s and could be targeted for further bone assessment/s or treatments. The lack of convincing evidence means screening for bone health is not routinely carried out in the NHS.AIMS: We aim to study if there is an increased risk of bone fracture/s following bariatric surgery. In addition, we will look for key factors that can be combined in a risk scoring tool to identify those most likely to suffer such fractures.DESIGN/METHODS: We will use anonymised GP and hospital records to study these associations in real-world clinical practice conditions, and amongst actual NHS patients. According to figures provided by these data sources, >10,900 patients undergoing bariatric surgery for obesity are available for such a study. To avoid the biases mentioned above we will use advanced methods applied in drug and vaccine safety studies (called ‚Äòself-controlled case series‚Äô), where the risk of fracture in the periods before and after surgery are compared for each patient.\n",

Indeed, survival in lung cancer is clearly influenced by persistent smoking. Unfortunately little data is available concerning smoking cessation and thus physicians are reluctant to recommend cessation in this setting. Our aim is therefore to evaluate a comprehensive smoking cessation intervention using pharmacotherapy and motivational interviewing in patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer. To understand the obstacles to patients of quitting smoking, depression as well as nicotine withdrawal symptoms will be evaluated. This is a monocenter, 12-week, prospective, observational, non-comparative trial performed at a large University lung cancer center. We assume that 80 patients are willing to participate with 90% being evaluated at 12 weeks. Smoking will be validated biochemically by exhaled carbon monoxide (CO). Nicotine withdrawal symptoms and depression will be evaluated by questionnaires. The primary endpoint is the abstinence rate at week 12 as based on biochemical verification. Secondary endpoints will be safety and 26-week data. The evaluations will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Given previous experience of our group it will be possible to demonstrate the 12-week abstinence rate to be significantly above 45% with a power of at least 80% at a one-sided significance level of 5%.

            "study_description In February 2017, CT-P10 became the first biosimilar version of rituximab to be approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of rheumatic diseases and specific blood cancers including non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). The safety profile of rituximab has been documented in numerous clinical trials, with infusion-related reactions (IRRs), thought to be related to the release of cytokines, being the most commonly reported adverse reaction. To minimise the risk of IRRs, the standard administration protocol for rituximab, specified in the summary of product characteristics, takes approximately three to four hours for the first infusion and two to three hours for subsequent infusions for oncology treatment. This standard infusion protocol places a significant burden on the healthcare system and patients and, consequently, many healthcare professionals now administer rituximab as a rapid infusion (over a period of 90 minutes or less) for second or subsequent infusions in patients who did not experience serious complications with their initial infusion(s). A number of studies have been conducted to evaluate the safety of rapid infusion of rituximab in patients with haematological malignancies and have generally shown rapid administration to be safe and well-tolerated, with low incidences of IRRs. However, there are very limited data available on the safety of rapid infusion of CT-P10. These data are important to inform future decisions by physicians and healthcare providers regarding the most appropriate and cost-effective treatment strategy. This study will address this evidence gap by collecting real world data on the safety and effectiveness of rapidly infused CT-P10 in patients with NHL and CLL in Europe.\n",

In France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom (UK) it is licensed as TruximaTM for intravenous use in adults with rheumatoid arthritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis, non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) represents 30 to 58% of NHL, with the crude incidence in Europe being 3.8 per 100,000 patient years (5). Patients with DLBCL are often treated with a combination of four chemotherapy drugs, plus rituximab immunotherapy, known by the acronym R-CHOP (6). Clinical similarity between CT-P10 and rituximab has been accepted by the EMA (7). It has been reported that the introduction of CT-P10 in Europe will be associated with significant budget savings, with the reallocation of such enabling more patients to access treatment (8). However, there are currently no studies investigating the effectiveness or safety of CT-P10 treatment in patients with DLBCL in the real world clinical setting. This study will therefore address this evidence gap by collecting real world data on the effectiveness and safety of CT-P10 treatment in patients with DLBCL in European countries.\n",

            "study_description Despite the availability of effective treatments, numerous studies (also in Spain) have shown a high prevalence of sub-optimal control of asthma that is associated with an increase of exacerbations which, when they are moderate to severe, entail significant use of expensive health care resources. The negative effects of inadequate control of asthma include increased risk of exacerbations, more emergency room visits and hospitalizations and higher mortality rate. In fact, patients with uncontrolled asthma have higher costs and lower quality of life than patients who are controlled.In our context, the evidence available in the real-world setting about how these patients are and how they are managed in the spanish National Health System is very scarce. There are few population-based studies, and in most cases, there are only small cohorts that may suffer from biases of representativeness and observation, which limits their extrapolation to all asthmatic patients with exacerbations. In the Valencian Community there is the ability to carry out studies in the real-world setting thanks to the availability of different population-based clinical and management information systems, that can be linked to individual patients through a unique identifier.The current project focuses on describing the characteristics of asthmatic patients with exacerbations, pharmacotherapeutic management patterns after exacerbation, and the use of associated health care resources, from a real-world population cohort that includes the entire population of asthma patients with exacerbations of the Valencian Community.\n",

Despite being an anti-asthmatic medicine, it is often prescribed for colds, coughs and sore throats. In the Enbe Study (Effectiveness of beclomethasone versus placebo in the treatment of preventing viral wheezing in the pre-school age group) beclomethasone reduced the risk of viral wheezing by 4% (from 11 to 7%) but the difference was not statistically significant. The results of Enbe confirms data already highlighted by some studies: that the IS has a modest effectiveness in preventing both recurrent wheezing viral and that of respiratory syncytial virus infections ( bronchiolitis) in the child. In addition, no benefits were noted in reducing symptoms of infection to the respiratory tract. Therefore a more rational effort is needed regarding these pharmaceuticals both by doctors and above all by parents who frequently administer medicines to children for infections of the respiratory tract, without consulting their pediatrician. Phase IV research project will be conducted by Family Pediatricians (FP) that can foresee on the one hand, training courses for FP and informational for families regarding the correct use of respiratory medication the ISs any iatrogenic illness caused by their improper use, on the other hand which may constitute a territorial survey on prescriptive appropriateness and safety of these pharmaceuticals in children aimed at evaluating the risk-benefit balance on usage.\n",

            "study_description The treatment of COPD involves multiple therapies, including long-acting bronchodilators (LAMAs and LABAs) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), with dual combinations of these drugs now formulated into single inhalers. Recently, several single-inhaler triple therapies involving an LABA-LAMA-ICS combination are being developed and being tested for effectiveness in randomized trials. The TRILOGY and TRINITY trials compared a single-inhaler triple therapy with an LABA-ICS and a LAMA respectively and found greater benefit with triple therapy. The TRIBUTE trial and ongoing IMPACT trial also compare triple therapy with a dual long-acting bronchodilator regimen (LABA-LAMA). These trials, however, have methodological issues related to the deleterious effect of withdrawal of maintenance treatment at randomization, the use of run-in periods and the truncated follow-up at treatment discontinuation. Moreover, they represent a limited view of the patients who could potentially use these treatments, so that a real-world study of patients who are representative of clinical practice is of interest.As many of these drugs have been in use in separate inhalers for many years, an observational study of the comparative effectiveness of triple therapy is feasible and would provide useful data on the relative benefits of different combinations in the treatment of COPD. The intended audience is payers and prescribers. The results from the study will be published in the scientific literature.\n",

The original database included data from 19 registries covering a population of 4 million births, 1995-2005. The database was used to conduct a case-control study evaluating the risk of orofacial clefts in relation to lamotrigine exposure. The study found no evidence of a specific increased risk of isolated orofacial clefts relative to other malformations due to lamotrigine monotherapy. In order to estimate the risk of orofacial clefts relative to other malformations more precisely and to explore whether lamotrigine exposure may be associated with other malformations, a follow-up study was commissioned. This involved 5 yearly updates (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013). The final study included data from 21 registries and covered over 10 million births. No evidence of an increased risk of orofacial clefts relative to other malformations associated with lamotrigine exposure in the first trimester was found.\n",

            "study_description Ketoprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with analgesic and antipyretic effects. Topical ketoprofen is used in more than 70 countries worldwide. In spite of having been associated with photocontact dermatitis, limited data are available on incidence rate of reactions leading to hospitalization and on risk factor for the reaction.As requested by EMA in 2010 (procedure No. EMEA/H/A-107/1259) and to better evaluate the risk and benefit profile of topical ketoprofen, an epidemiologic case-control study was proposed focusing on severe photosensitivity reactions leading to hospitalization and assessing risks linked to the use of topical ketoprofen and other topical NSAIDs. The study will be conducted on a Europe-wide scale and requires that clear assumptions are made about exposure rates, criteria to define cases of severe photosensitivity, and incidence of severe photosensitivity reactions.To assess the feasibility of such a case-control study before embarking into a Europe-wide large-scale endeavor, a pilot study will be conducted focusing on incidence rates of severe photosensitivity reactions leading to hospitalization, and prevalence of exposure to topical ketoprofen among controls. These pieces of information will be used to estimate the sample size and the statistica power of the case control study. The pilot phase will also address methodological issues granting validity to the study, including standardization of diagnostic criteria and comparison between exposure among controls and exposure in the underlined at risk population so that indirect methods to assess attributable risks could be applied in the case control study.Centers in three geographic areas, intended to represent the variety of Europe in terms of different rates of exposure to topical NSAIDs and of incidence of photosensitivity reactions, will participate to this pilot study (Lombardy region, Paris metropolitan area, Prague metropolitan area).\n",

            "study_description The treatment of COPD increasingly involves multiple therapies, including long-acting bronchodilators (LAMAs and LABAs) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), with combinations of these drugs now formulated into single inhalers. The use of ICS has increased disproportionately with respect to COPD treatment guidelines and may be inappropriate in a subset of these users. New evidence suggests that patients can be safely weaned off ICS, including the WISDOM trial that observed no difference in the risk of moderate or severe exacerbations between patients who discontinued ICS and those who continued receiving ICS. Moreover, discontinuation of ICS has been associated with a reduction in the risk of pneumonia. While most trials of the combination treatments have been conducted against the respective mono components or placebo, very few head-to-head trials versus other combinations have been performed to date. For example, the recent FLAME randomized trial reported that patients receiving the LABA-LAMA combination had fewer exacerbations than those receiving the LABA-ICS combination over a one-year follow-up period. Also, the ENERGITO trial reported significant improvements in lung function with a LAMA/LABA combination versus LABA/ICS in GOLD 2-3 patients after 6 weeks of treatment. These trials, however, represent a limited view of the patients who could potentially use these treatments, with many exclusion criteria based on for example stage of disease, lung function and exacerbation history, as well as exclusions of many patients during the screening and run-in periods. Thus, a real-world study of patients who are representative of clinical practice is of interest.\n",

Data about the incidence of bleeding in Emergency Room (ER) are lacking in literature, even if several studies report emergency admissions for haemorrhages associated with specific drugs or apparatuses. The retrospective observational study Haemorrhagic Adverse Reactions in Emergency Room (HARER) was designed in order to estimate the incidence of bleeding events and the incidence of suspected haemorrhagic adverse drug reactions as causes of Emergency Room visits. HARER takes into consideration the computerized medical records from two Emergency Departments of the University Hospital in Verona (Italy) from 2015 to 2016 over a twelve month period. According to a validated list available in literature, patients aged ‚â• 18 years with an International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis code at admission related to haemorrhage, but not caused by traumatic events, were included in the study.

            "study_description Methotrexate (MTX) is known as a teratogen that causes a specific embryopathy. This is based on several retrospective case reports (e.g. Seidahmed 2006, Yedlinski 2005, Adam 2003, Chapa 2003, Kr√§henmann 2002, Wheeler 2002, Bawle 1998, and Milunsky 1968.). MTX has been used as an abortifacient, in cancer therapy, and beginning in the 90th for rheumatoid arthritis and some autoimmune diseases. The dose of MTX varies depending on the treatment indication and is lower in rheumatic diseases. There is still uncertainty concerning the risk of low-dose methotrexate therapy during pregnancy. As there is only one small prospective study, which observed no major birth defects in 28 pregnancies (Lewden 2004), no precise risk evaluation can be made so far. Furthermore, it has been debated how long prior to conception MTX therapy should be stopped. Recently, a broad international panel of rheumatologists recommended stopping MTX at least 3 months before conception (Visser 2009). Study Target: To assess the risk of low-dose MTX exposure in early pregnancy. Primary Outcome:Rate of major birth defects, rate of specific MTX embryopathy (time frame up to approximately 8 weeks after birth), rate of spontaneous abortion, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) in malformed and non malformed newborns (criterion: birth weigth), rate of prematurity. There are three prospectively ascertained groups to be compared:1) Exposed group with maternal exposure of low-dose MTX for rheumatic/autoimmune diseases, 2) Control group 1 (‚Äúdisease group‚Äù): Pregnant women with rheumatic /autoimmune diseases without MTX during pregnancy, 3) Non-exposed control group 2 (‚Äúgeneral control‚Äù): No MTX, no rheumatic / autoimmune diseases.\n",

            "study_description This study aims to collect data on application experiences of phytopharmaceuticals. The majority of phytopharmaceuticals in Germany are not covered by the statutory health insurance. Therefore GPs don't have the feasibility to prescribe herbal medicines nor to follow up the treatment. Furthermore the patients' compliance is hardly or not auditable. Data regarding reasons for applying pharmaceuticals, adverse effects or tolerance to herbal medicines are not systematically collected in Germany.PhytoVIS was initiated in order to gain information on the effect experience of patients taking phytompharmaceuticals. The study is not designed to take into account specific subgroups, but to collect data of all natural persons who have been taking herbal medicine during the previous eight weeks on the date of questioning. Amoung others the 'Clinical Global Impression Scale - Efficacy' (GGI-E) questionnaire will be used. Nota bene this study cannot deliver specific proofs on the effectiveness of different drugs. Rather PhytoVIS takes into account the overall effect experience during the therapeutic intervention. Thereby other factors and the course of disease play a role. Concerning adverse events no linkage to causal relationships is possible. Yet all adverse events will be documented and allow a more detailed evaluation. In addition to that data gained on children, pregnant women, and elderly people are valuable, since there are hardly any data available on these subgroups. A secondary endpoint of PhytoVIS is the collection of information on the way of purchase of the medicine as well as on way of recommendation, which will add to the knowledge on health services research.20 000 data sets will be collected via the online database 'PhytoVIS', that was successfully tested and validated in a pilot phase with 2000 data sets. Natural persons will be questioned at pharmacies.\n",

It modifies neuronal activity, binding Œ±2Œ¥1 presynaptic voltage-dependent calcic channel receptor, which is responsible for its psychotropic action. Neuropsychiatric adverse drug reactions, such as euphoria, have been described. Pregabalin abuse has been suggested in a few toxicological studies, pharmacovigilance studies, and small surveys among opioid users or treated by opiate maintenance drugs. Despite signals of abuse in some European countries, no data suggest a potential for pregabalin abuse in France, and no study has ever compare pregabalin abuse to other drug used in the same indication. Searching a possible pregabalin abuse seems all the more relevant as its consumption increases in France and in Europe. This study aims to investigate pregabalin abuse and its frequency in the French general population, in comparison with other drugs used in similar indications and to determine the factors associated with pregabalin abuse.\n",

In 2009 there was an increase in reporting linked to the pandemic influenza vaccine, while in 2011-2012 many reports are linked to the active post licensure safety monitoring of HPV vaccine. The new Pharmacovigilance legislation came into force in Europe in July 2012 and one of the indication was to increase the involvement of patients in reporting systems. Objective: the surveillance of adverse event after immunization (AEFI) reported by patients. Methods: Every adverse event should be reported immediately to healthcare professional in the vaccination center. The safety of vaccines is linked to the constant surveillance of adverse events. In this study all vaccinated children until to 15 months age were involved. For each vaccination parents will receive a Vaccination Diary for surveillance of adverse events by the healthcare professional, accompanied by a letter describing this project and reminding the importance of reporting.

A medication error is a failure in the treatment process that leads to, or has the potential to lead to, harm to the patient. Prescription errors account for 70% of medication errors that could potentially result in adverse drug effects. Objectives: A study has been projected to evaluate the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) due to medication errors in hospitalized patients before and after educational audits. Methods: All patients, aged ‚â•18 years, hospitalized in seven unit (three internal medicine and four geriatric) of the University Hospital of Verona during 3 months period (February- April 2013) were included in this study. The project was articled in 3 phases. In the first one, three monitors registered all ADRs occurred during hospital stay. Two panel of experts (6 physicians, 2 pharmacists and 2 pharmacologists) established, evaluating the available clinic information (e.g. clinical sheet) of all patients and according the Schumock and Thornton algorithm, if the ADRs were due to medication errors or not, in the case of error they identified the cause. At first the two panel worked separately, at a later stage a data condivision has been done to have shared data. In the second phase, educational audits directed to health care practitioners have been organized, and tools (e.g., check-list) to reduce the medication errors have been proposed. The third phase, that is similar to the first one and takes account of tools, is in progress. Preliminary Results: Preliminary data of the first phase showed that 1474 have been enrolled in the seven units involved, the analysis has been done for 1009 patients (68%) (median age: 76 years old with DS ¬± 15,2, female: 51%) who gave their informed consent.

Paediatric patients are at a higher riskthan adults of experiencing such problems because of the need for a dose calculation based onthe patient‚Äôs age, weight (mg/kg), body surface area (mg/m 2 ), and clinical condition.Antibiotics are the medications most widely prescribed in the paediatric population and one of thedrug classes most commonly reported to be involved in paediatric dosing errors.Despite a number of studies conducted about antibiotics usage in different European countries,the appropriateness of antibiotic dosing (prescribed by doctors in primary or secondary care,dispensed by community or hospital pharmacies, or administered in hospital settings) according tothe child‚Äôs age, weight and height (and other related parameters, as Body Mass Index - BMI, BodySurface Area - BSA) has not yet been investigated.In this study, we would like to assess in European Medical Information Framework (EMIF)Electronic Healthcare Records (EHR) databases (DBs) the relationship between dosing ofantibiotics prescribed, administered or dispensed (either for outpatients or inpatient settings) tochildren (age 0-18 yr), and their weight, age and height.\n",

            "study_description Background. Heart failure (HF) patients often exhibit several comorbidities that contribute to affect prognosis. In particular, type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is common in HF with prevalence from 10 to 30% and adversely influences long-term morbidity and mortality of symptomatic and asymptomatic HF patients. The results of a recent study on the effects of the anti-diabetic drug empagliflozin, reported unattended and substantial favorable effects on cardiovascular outcomes, and in particular a striking reduction of HF hospitalization, that was consistently demonstrated in patients with and without HF at baseline. The mechanisms behind these effects are unknown and many potential contributors have been advocated, including effects on plasma volume, arterial stiffness, sympathetic nervous system modulation and cardiac remodeling.Objectives. Aim of the present study is to investigate the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of empagliflozin on cardiovascular outcomes in diabetic patients affected by chronic HF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. In particular, the primary endpoint is to assess the effect of empagliflozin on left ventricular remodeling and function and on biomarkers of HF hemodynamic status. Secondary endpoint is to assess the effects of empagliflozin on myocardial sympathetic nervous system activity.Methods. Prospective cohort study. Patients will receive empagliflozin according to diabetologists‚Äô prescription. Endpoints will be evaluated by in each study procedure by two investigators blinded to personal patients‚Äô data and treatment allocation. On the first study day patients will undergo clinical examination, echocardiography and I123MIBG Imaging to assess myocardial adrenergic status. Then patients will start the prescribed treatment and after 6-9 months of follow-up will repeat the baseline study procedures to assess the effects of empagliflozin on study outcomes.\n",

Moderate to severe 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) deficiency is frequent, probably underdiagnosed, and possibly associated with the increase of other health outcomes. However, except in specific populations, the effect of vitamin D supplementation in deficient patients is still debated. Our purpose was to compare health care use after vitamin D supplementation versus before in patients likely to have 25(OH)D deficiency.Design - A before-after cohort study in a young to middle-aged population of patients with a prescription of 25(OH)D dosage from their physician was conductedSetting - The Insurance Healthcare System of the Rh√¥ne-Alpes area (France) database was used to follow ambulatory patients reimbursed for a 25(OH)D assay between December 1st 2008 and January 31th 2009.Interventions - Data on healthcare use were extracted over 5 months before and 5 months after the assay, including physician visits and medical interventions, number and type of drug prescriptions, mean number of drug classes per distinct prescriptions, medical imaging use, biology exams use, presence incident sick leaves, and incident hospitalizations.Outcomes : An individual was considered ‚Äú25(OH)D deficient‚Äù if they had a record of a vitamin D assay for a dosage of 25(OH)D followed by vitamin D supplementation (i.e. at least one occurrence of vitamin D2 or Vitamin D3 delivery in the 3 months after the assay). Patients who were not prescribed vitamin D after their assay were considered as ‚Äúnot 25(OH)D deficient‚Äù and became part of the control group. The index date was the date of supplementation for the 25(OH)D deficient group and the date of 25(OH)D assay for the reference group. We compared the evolution of extracted data between the before and the after period.\n",

A set of four proof-of-concept (POC) studies were earlier conducted to assess the feasibility of and to establish processes for generating the required data to perform the B/R assessment of vaccines in Europe. Particularly, these studies assessed the feasibility for generating data for vaccination (1) coverage, (2) benefit and (3) risk, and (4) for synthesizing the obtained evidence using B/R modeling (refs). As test-case for these POC studies, it was assessed if the initial B/R profile of pertussis vaccines was maintained after the switch from whole cell pertussis (wP) vaccines to acellular pertussis (aP) vaccines. The current POC study builds further upon the previous study and assesses the feasibility of obtaining near-real time data from EU EHR databases. The success of near-real time B/R monitoring fully relies on data being timely available, i.e. both frequent up-to-date and small time-lag between the occurrence of the event and it being recorded in the databases. The current study makes use of previously developed methodological work on near-real time and visual monitoring of vaccination coverage, benefits, risks and B/R using an interactive dashboard, where the developments were based on simulated data. The objectives of the current POC study are therefore twofold: 1. to explore the capacity of EU EHR databases to provide near-real time data and 2. to demonstrate the practical potential of the proposed B/R monitoring methodology using real-world data from various EU EHR databases.\n",

            "study_description With the introduction of novel therapies for asthma, it will be useful to differentiate patient need by clinical status (severity) and biomarkers.Patients with severe asthma may be eligible for these potentially life transforming treatments. Biological therapies demonstrate successful outcomes but are (and as new therapies become available, will be) restricted in use by both an assessment of need after optimised care and a biomarker profile consistent with product licenses. Two biomarkers of interest are currently available in routine clinical practice, Blood eosinophil count and total and specific IgE levels. The biological therapy omalizumab may be indicated in patients with severe asthma and an appropriate, raised, IgE. Anti Il-5s (and other therapies) may be indicated in patients with severe asthma and raised blood eosinophil counts. As periostin estimation is not currently in routine use, this biomarker (and its possible guide to Il-13 drug therapy) is not considered in this project.One traditional view is that eosinophil counts and IgE levels are associated. Recent anecdotal evidence proposes that the relationship may not be consistent and that a group of patients who are both eosinophil high and IgE low may exist, for example.By defining the biomarker status of a cohort of people with severe asthma we can estimate the potential impact of precision medicine through appropriate biological therapies for these patients.A preliminary search of the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) Safe Haven database (n=1.4 million) revealed that about 10,000 IgE levels were requested last year Of these, 1850 were from patients aged 18 years or over who had a Read or ICD code for asthma Study aim: To categorise people with severe asthma according to their eosinophil and total IgE biomarker status.\n",

Existing experience during pregnancy does not suggest teratogenicity, but varies between the different substances and altogether is still limited. Furthermore, there are concerns against the use of TNF-Œ± inhibitors in late pregnancy, because at least some of them exhibit an increasing placental transfer during the course of pregnancy. This results in therapeutic fetal/neonatal plasma concentrations. A case report of a newborn raises concern. The mother was treated with infliximab throughout pregnancy. The 3-months old infant received BCG live-vaccination resulting in disseminated BCG infection and ultimately in the death of the child (Cheent 2010). Our prospective multicenter cohort study enrolls women who have spontaneously contacted a teratology information service (TIS) within the European Network (ENTIS). The sample of exposed pregnancies includes women who were treated with a TNF-alpha inhibitor during the first trimester (part 1). The comparison group consists of non-exposed women matched for year of enrollment and TIS. The focus lies on the risk of birth defects (BD), spontaneous abortion, and low birth weight. Part 2 evaluates potential impacts of maternal TNF-Œ± inhibitors on the infant‚Äôs immune system during the 1st year of life.

However, as it is the case with any medicinal product, real-life use of E. may differ from or extend beyond the patient population that has been studied in the phase 3 program or is included under the approved indication. One of the concerns in real-world use of medicinal practices is the off-label use. Daiichi Sankyo (DS) addressed this concern in the Risk Management Plan in order to anticipate necessary risk minimization activities. The potential off-label use of E. in unapproved indications was considered low, because of the availability of approved, indicated and well-established treatment alternatives. In order to further optimise the correct use of the medicinal product by the physician, DS is implementing additional risk minimisation activities such as a prescriber guide as part of the educational programs for prescribers (information about approved indications, E. eligible patients, dosing and safety concerns management) and patient alert card.The Drug Utilisation Study (DUS) aims to gain insight on how this new European medicinal product is going to be used in real practice.\n",

To evaluate the effects of the combined therapy with Myo-inositol (MI) and D-chiro-inositol (DCI) on hormonal and metabolic parameters of women with PCOS.Design. Prospective clinical study.Setting. PCOS patients in a clinical research environment.Patients. Seventy women diagnosed with PCOS according to Rotterdam criteria were enrolled in this study.Interventions. Patients received combined therapy of one tablet that contained 550 mg of inositol (myo-inositol (MI) and D-chiro-inositol (DCI) in a ratio of 10:1), 200 Œºg of folic acid, 500 IU of vitamin D, 0.7 mg of vitamin B6, 3 mg of vitamin B5, 1.25 Œºg of vitamin B12 twice a day for 6 months. At each visit, the body weight, height and BMI were all recorded, and serum levels of free testosterone (fT), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and glucose with insulin during standard OGTT (75 g) were all measured as well. Moreover transvaginal ultrasonography and skin condition assessment were performed at each visit. Results. Significant body weight reduction and decrease in fT, FSH, LH and insulin levels as well as significant increase of serum SHBG concentration were observed. Serum glucose levels during OGTT decreased after 6 months of treatment. Also skin conditions improved after just three months of treatment.Conclusions. Combination of MI and DCI in a ratio 10:1 seems to be efficient in improving both metabolic and hormonal parameters in PCOS patients.\n",

            "study_description Fibromyalgia is a common cause of diffuse, chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults, with an estimated prevalence between 2 and 5% in the general population. Even though its aetiology and pathophysiology are not fully understood, current evidence suggests that, similarly to other chronic pain syndromes, this is a disorder of pain regulation characterized by altered pain and sensory processing in the central nervous system, likely due to maladaptive plasticity in pain-related neural circuits. Thus, the use of neuro-stimulation approaches is of particular relevance in fibromyalgia, a chronic pain disorder where pain can be characterized by a lack of inhibitory control over somatosensory processing and that is often refractory to multiple therapeutic strategies.Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising technique that allows to non-invasively modulate brain activity by applying a low intensity current (1 to 2 mA) via scalp electrodes. Stimulation effects and after-effects depend on the current polarity under each electrode. Indeed, motor cortex stimulation studies have shown that with standard parameters, anodal stimulation enhances cortical excitability, while cathodal stimulation decreases cortical excitability.Some studies have explored the analgesic effects of tDCS in chronic pain, including fibromyalgia, both stimulating M1 and/or the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, F3). However, a recent meta-analysis has stressed the poor methodological quality of most previous studies, leading to non-significant results of and the need for larger, rigorously designed studies. This study aims to obtain more information on the therapeutic use of tDCS for pain relief, and to respond to two important challenges of this area of research: (a) the need of more sham-controlled studies with a sufficient number of patients and long follow-up, (b) the need to explore novel targets in pain-related brain regions, such as the operculo-insular cortex.\n",

            "study_description Osteoporosis (OP) is a systemic skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass and bone structure deterioration leading to increased fracture risk. The main clinical complication of OP is increased susceptibility to fractures due to bone fragility. A number of guidelines propose oral bisphosphonates (BP) as first-line therapies to prevent fragility fractures in osteoporotic patients, and aim at reducing the risk of fractures by 50%. Some studies have been previously conducted and identified risk factors for imminent fracture in OP patients under BP therapy. However, some discrepancies were also found across studies.Another approach to early identify patients at higher risk of imminent fracture while under BP treatment is to use one of the predictive tools derived and validated in untreated populations, and to modify/calibrate them as needed. The QFracture risk score is a predictive tool derived in na√Øve patients for long-term risk fracture, that has been validated three times and updated in 2012. QFracture can also model 1-year imminent fracture risk, but its validity for such prediction has not been tested to date. The objectives of the study are:Primary: to undertake a comprehensive descriptive analysis of the six proposed high fracture risk subcohorts, in regards with clinical, social and socio-economic characteristics, and to estimate the 1-year and 2-year fracture incidence rates and cumulative incidence functions over time in the six defined subcohorts Secondary: to conduct an external validation of QFracture risk score in the six predefined high risk subcohorts (see below) for 1-year imminent fracture prediction, to estimate 1-year and 2-year incidence rates of fatal fracture, rates (in patients with linked hospital data available) of fracture-related hospitalizations, and mortality, and to study the anti-osteoporotic drug exposure during the follow-up period.\n",

It was approved by the European Commission on January 24th 2013. For reasons of conciseness, the indication throughout this protocol is termed adolescent bipolar I mania.As part of marketing authorisation approval, the ABILIFY¬Æ risk management plan (RMP) requires distribution of two Risk Minimisation (RM) communication tools, additional to the SmPC, to Healthcare Providers (HCPs) prescribing ABILIFY¬Æ for the adolescent bipolar I mania indication.These tools are a Healthcare Provider Frequently Asked Questions Brochure (HCP FAQ) and a Patient / Caregiver Information Brochure (PCIB). The purpose of the HCP FAQ is to clearly explain to prescribers or other HCPs involved in patient treatment the need to carefully consider the indicated age range, dose, and duration of treatment before prescribing ABILIFY¬Æ for the adolescent bipolar I mania indication. Furthermore, vigilance is urged in the on-going evaluation of weight gain, EPS, and ADRs related to somnolence and fatigue. A PCIB is available for physicians to give to their patients (and their caregivers) to help them better understand and recognise specific ADRs. The EU-RMP committed Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd., as the marketing authorisation holder (MAH), to evaluate the effectiveness of these additional RM activities (i.e. the RM tools and their distribution) for the adolescent bipolar I mania indication.\n",

While the latter maybe related to the cancer disease itself, it is most commonly the consequence ofcancer-specific treatments, notably chemotherapy. Anemia is defined as a reduction in the total amount of circulating functional haemoglobin. Fatigue is the quality of life(QL)-impacting symptom which is the most commonly reported by patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, with an incidence of over 70 % of patients 1. Patients describe it as the symptom which most affects their daily life (67%), or even as their main problem (37%) 1.The EORTC QLQ C30 multicriteria scale 2 has been validated on over 10,000 patients and is widely used in clinical practice to evaluate the QL of cancer patients. The use of a single-criterion evaluation test such as the Fatigue Visual Analog Scale (VAS) which evaluates fatigue on a scale from 0 (no fatigue at all) to 10 (extreme fatigue), is considered, due to its simplicity, as the most appropriate way to self evaluate 3.Binocrit¬Æ (epoetin alfa), an erythropoeisis-stimulating agent, is administered to patients with chemotherapy-induced anaemia (CIA) with the aim of increasing their haemoglobin level, avoiding blood transfusions, and improving patient QL 4, notably by improving fatigue.The main objective of the study is to determine the correlation between fatigue, evaluated by VAS, and QL, using EORTC QLQ C30, perceived by patients with solid tumour, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma and treated with Binocrit¬Æ for a CIA.This study will also help to assess the perception that physicians have of their patients' fatigue. The patient's inclusion and follow-up in the study will occur as part of their usual care.No further tests are planned which could hinder the patients' usual treatment.

In this pilot study we aimed to identify patients with first-time positive ANA and musculoskeletal complaints, and correlate serum soluble vascular adhesion molecules as biomarkers.Methods: Prospective, observational study with 100 ANA-positive patients, comparing them to age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC, n=75). Serum levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (sELAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) were measured. A subgroup of patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) treated with immunosuppressants was followed over 10 months.Results: Patients belonged to three main entities: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n=32), collagen diseases (CD, n=56) also including systemic sclerosis (SSc, n=11), and other autoimmune diseases (n=12). sICAM-1 was similar among groups. sELAM-1 was elevated by 1.9-fold in only in SSc. sVCAM-1 was elevated by 3.1-fold in RA, by 3.3-fold in CD, and other autoimmune diseases by 3.4-fold. 7 SSc-patients with immunosuppression had a 2.7-fold increased sVCAM-1 at baseline and reached the levels of healthy controls after 5 months, while CRP, ESR and clinical parameters remained unchained. Conclusion: This study suggests that sVCAM-1 is a disease marker independent from standard serum parameters in several rheumatic diseases.\n",

It can be expected that patients initiating empagliflozin may differ in their characteristics from patients initiating other glucose lowering drugs (GLDs) that have been on the market longer (e.g. patients may have poorer glucose control). Therefore, the proposed study aims to characterize patients with T2DM in the UK initiating empagliflozin in terms of baseline characteristics, concomitant medications, and comorbidities compared to patients with T2DM initiating other SGLT-2 inhibitors or other non-insulin GLDs. Due to the mode of action, some patients taking empagliflozin have experienced weight loss in clinical trials. A theoretical possibility exists that empagliflozin may be used by patients without T2DM. Therefore, this study also aims to assess the potential off-label use of empagliflozin compared to other non-insulin GLDs.\n",

            "study_description Sleep disturbance is common in dementia, and can severely affect patient and carer quality of life. Z-drugs (zolpidem, zaleplon and zopiclone) are sedating hypnotics that are used for insomnia in older people and in people with dementia. Current guidance suggests Z-drugs or short acting benzodiazepines (BZD) can relive sleep disturbance and can provide respite for carers. Nevertheless there are concerns about tolerance, addiction and the safety of Z-drugs, with adverse effects including increases in falls and fracture risk, impaired daytime cognition, and higher risks of infections. Other sedating neuroleptics are known to increase stroke risk and mortality, with mediating pathways including dehydration and over-sedation and it is important to confirm whether Z-drugs confer similar risks.Our aim is to understand the benefits and harms of using Z-drugs for people with dementia who have trouble sleeping. Using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink we will look at whether people with dementia who take Z-drugs fall more often, have more infections or are taken to hospital more often among other health outcomes. We will compare Z-drugs to other sleep drugs prescribed to people with dementia, and to people who do not use any sleep medication at all.\n",

It has been recently approved by the European Medical Agency (EMA) for use in adult patients for the treatment of acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE), and prevention of recurrent VTE in adults. According to current guidelines, duration of anticoagulant treatment after a venous thromboembolic event varies from 3 months to indefinite treatment depending on the estimated risks of venous thromboembolism (VTE) recurrence and bleeding. Current data for edoxaban are limited to a maximum treatment duration of 12 months (Hokusai-VTE, N Engl J Med. 2013, 369:1406-15). Therefore, this study aims to gather further insight into efficacy (i.e. symptomatic recurrent VTE) and safety (i.e. bleeding events, liver adverse events, all-cause mortality and other drug related adverse events) of extended treatment with edoxaban up to 18 months in an unselected patient population in routine clinical practice.\n",

Secondary objectives include the estimation of the incidence rates among patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina or myocardial infarction), exposed to the use of ticagrelor, clopidogrel, prasugrel, or none of these treatments, of the following events: recurrent myocardial infarction (rMI), stroke, major bleeding (requiring hospitalization) and non-major and death, to describe patterns of use for ticagrelor and other antiplatelet agents (indication, substitutions, etc.), including the discontinuation of treatment and reasons, and to study the influence of risk factors on the risk of cardiovascular events in participating patients and assess how these factors interact with ticagrelor and other antiplatelet drugs.The study design is a general cohort of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) followed for 12 months for the occurrences of interest. A case-cohort analysis will compare drug exposure between patients who have had an occurrence of interest to those who did not (population-time with no event). Medical information at baseline is entered by cardiologists in the PGRx system. Drug exposure is obtained from cardiologists and patients through standardized and validated telephone interviews. Events of interest are examined by an adjudication committee. A total of 3,750 patients with ACS will be needed to achieve a power of 80% to detect an Odds ration inferior to 0.8 for the comparison ticagrelor to the each of clopidogrel and prasugrel, assuming approximately equal exposure in the population of interest.\n",

            "study_description Objective: Our aim was to assess the role of the body mass index (BMI) in the clinical response to systemic treatment for psoriasis. Methods: A nationwide cohort study of patients receiving a new systemic treatment for plaque psoriasis at reference centres in Italy was conducted. Information was gathered through a web-based electronic form. Patients being maintained on the same medication and with data available at 8 and 16 weeks by March 31, 2007, were eligible. The outcome was a reduction in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) of at least 75% at follow-up compared to baseline (PASI-75). Results: Out of 8,072 patients enrolled, 2,368 were eligible and analysable at 8 weeks and 2,042 at 16 weeks. PASI-75 was achieved by 819 patients (34.5%) at 8 weeks and1,034 (50.6%) at 16 weeks. The proportion steadily decreased with increased values of BMI. Compared to normal weight (BMI = 20‚Äì24) the adjusted odds ratio for achieving PASI-75 in obese patients was 0.73 (95% CI = 0.58‚Äì0.93) at 8 weeks and 0.62 (95% CI = 0.49‚Äì0.79) at 16 weeks. The impact of the BMI did not show remarkable variations according to the drug prescribed at entry. Conclusion: The BMI affects the early clinical response to systemic treatment for psoriasis.\n",

They are commonly used and recommended in patients with dyslipidaemia (Catapano et al. 2011).3 Fibrates are also used to lower total cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) levels. They are prescribed to patients intolerant to statins alone, or as second line of treatment in combination with statins.Combination of simvastatin and fenofibrate leads to additional improvement of lipid parameters compared with simvastatin monotherapy in patients with mixed dyslipidaemia who required a treatment targeting a broader lipoprotein spectrum (Grundy et al. 2005).11Cholib¬Æ is a fixed combination tablet, composed of fenofibrate (145 mg) and simvastatin (20mg or 40mg). It will be the first available registered drug combining both substances in one tablet.Cholib¬Æ is indicated as adjunctive therapy to diet and exercise in high cardiovascular risk adult patients with mixed dyslipidaemia to reduce triglycerides and increase HDL- C levels when LDL-C levels are adequately controlled with the corresponding dose of simvastatin monotherapy.Initiation of Cholib¬Æ treatment requires an adequate pre-treatement with simvastatin (at 20 or 40 mg) otherwise it is considered off-label use. This potential risk is part of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and will be further investigated in this study conducted to estimate the proportion of patients who initiated Cholib¬Æ without prior simvastatin therapy.\n",

Objectives: 1) Examine the distribution of indications for Tygacil use in the EU before and after RMM implementation, 2) Determine the incidence of superinfection and lack of efficacy among adult patients treated with Tygacil for cSSTI and cIAI in the EU before and after RMM implementation.Data Collection:All patients treated with Tygacil for any indication during the study period will be retrospectively identified at participating centers in 3-6 of the top-prescribing EU countries. Patient medical records will be reviewed to determine indication for Tygacil use and to identify potential superinfection and lack of efficacy cases among those treated for approved indications. A committee of external adjudicators will review all relevant medical record data from these potential cases to determine their actual status. Methods:Frequencies of indications and the proportion of off-label use of Tygacil will be calculated before and after RMM implementation. The incidence of superinfection and lack of efficacy will be calculated in pre- and post-RMM periods among adult patients treated for cIAI and cSSTI. A descriptive analysis of pathogens associated with infection treated with Tygacil will be performed where microbiology data are available. An exploratory, hypothesis-generating multivariate comparative analysis will also be conducted to assess any change in superinfection and lack of efficacy between the pre- and post-RMM implementation period among on-label Tygacil users.\n",

Statins (or HMG -CoA reductase inhibitors) form a class of lipid-lowering drugs, drugs used to lower cholesterol levels in people at risk for cardiovascular disease. Statins are now considered as the most effective therapeutic class for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. They also demonstrated their beneficial effect on all-cause mortality decrease and on the occurrence of cardiovascular events.Statins are one of the main expenditure for the French health insurance since the early 2000s (1.28 billion euros in 2008). The financial burden associated with statins should remain a major concern in the coming years, particularly because of the aging population and the increased prevalence of risk factors such as diabetes or obesity, often associated with abnormal lipids. The objective of this study is to compare the use of health care, and the costs associated, with each patient cohorts differentiated by adherence to statin therapy, between 2005 and 2008, based on the French health national insurance database (EGB) which contains healthcare reimbursement data of 1/97 of the French population.The study mainly describes the annualized costs of care use in patients who have had an introduction to statin therapy and compares these costs between three cohorts defined by the level of adherence to statin therapy.

The SCCS methodology can be applied to those patients who have experienced the outcome of interest and have been exposed to risk factor(s) over some period of time. The method considers how frequently the outcome occurs during exposure compared to non-exposed times.All patients in THIN who had a code for RD and for a FQ in the interval from 1 Jan 1990 to 31 Dec 2012 were considered for the study. The study period began once a patient has attended a THIN practice for at least one year and any record of RD during this screening period resulted in exclusion from the study.The risk period was calculated using information on the prescribed quantity and the dosage regimen from the THIN dosage file. The primary analysis considered the risk period to be only those days when the patient was judged to be taking the FQ. When there was insufficient information to calculate the risk period it was imputed using the modal calculated value for the particular product prescribed. A sensitivity analysis used the minimum and maximum credible values for each product and the number and proportion of imputed values has been reported.Other risk factors for retinal detachment included in the model were traumatic events which encompassed cataract or other ocular surgery, eye infections, ocular trauma and head or neck injuries, exposure to corticosteroids, age and season.\n",

            "study_description Hypoglycaemia events occur among diabetes patients who use insulin for treatment of diabetes mellitus. From the oral treatments supholnylurea (SU) products can also cause hypoglycaemia. Risk of hypoglycaemia is increased with age and duration of diabetes. Severe hypoglycemia can result in permanent neurological sequelae including neuronal cell death. Hypoglycemia also increases platelet aggregation and fibrinogen formation, which may accelerate vascular compromise in the brain. Among older patients with type 2 diabetes, a history of severe hypoglycaemic episodes severe enough to require hospitalization or an emergency department visit are associated with increased risk of dementia, particularly for patients who have a history of multiple episodes.The development of long-acting basal insulin analogues with improved pharmacokinetics, which are able to more closely replicate endogenous insulin secretion, has been shown to have a positive effect on the balance between effective glycaemic control and hypoglycaemic risk compared to NPH insulin. The primary aim of this retrospective follow-up study is to evaluate the differences in the incidence of the hospitalization and the secondary health care visits due to diabetes mellitus with hypoglycaemic coma between the different insulins.\n",

            "study_description OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether statistical signal detection in spontaneous reporting data can lead to earlier detection of drug safety problems and to assess the additional regulatory work entailed. METHODS: Using the EudraVigilance post-authorization module (EVPM), a screening procedure based on the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) was applied retrospectively to examine if regulatory investigations concerning ADRs could have been initiated earlier than occurred in practice. During the same time period (Sep03 - Mar07), the number of PRR-based signals of disproportionate reporting (SDR) that arose in a predefined set of products was calculated and evaluated to determine the number requiring investigation. RESULTS: In 191 chemically different products, 532 adverse reactions were added to the summary of product characteristics during the study period. Of these, 405 were designated as important medical events (IMEs) based on a comprehensive predefined list. Of the IMEs, 217 (53.6%) were identified earlier by the statistical screening technique, 79 (19.6%) were detected after the date at which they were raised by standard pharmacovigilance (PhV) methods and 109 (26.9%) were not signalled during the study period. 1561 SDRs requiring further evaluation were detected during the study period, giving a ratio of 7.2 assessments for each signal pre-empted. The mean delay between the discovery of signals using the statistical methods in the EVPM and established methods in the 217 cases detected earlier was 2.45 years. A review resulted in clear explanation for why the statistical method had not pre-empted detection in all but 77 of 188 cases. CONCLUSIONS: The form of statistical signal detection tested in this study can provide significant early warning in a large proportion of drug safety problems, however, it cannot detect all safety issues more quickly than other PhV processes and hence it should be used in addition to, rather than as an alternative to, established methods.\n",

            "study_description Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a chronic illness with both incidence and prevalence increasing worldwide. Although life style modifications play an important role in type 2 DM treatment, due to the progressive natural course of the disease, most of the patients also require pharmacotherapy targeted to glycemic control. One of the major challenges in the treatment of DM is to achieve glycemic control while avoiding episodes of hypoglycemia. In Portugal, hypoglycemia severity and frequency remain poorly documented. In light with this, the aim of this study is to characterize and to determine the proportion of ambulatory type 2 DM patients with mild to moderate hypoglycemia episodes in Portugal treated with antihyperglycemic agent (AHA).This is an observational, cross-sectional multicenter study of treated type 2 DM, recruited through community pharmacies, which will collect information through a structured questionnaire delivered upon the presentation of a prescription to purchase an AHA. Study population comprised type 2 diabetics aged over 40, which agree to participate and sign an informed consent. Patients are required to be at least for 3 months in the current AHA and will be assigned into one of the four different therapeutic groups (Group 1: Insulin based therapy, Group 2: Secretagogue based therapy, Group 3: Other AHA excluding Secretagogue and insulin, and Group 4: Combination of Insulin and Secretagogue).

Globally there is also a paucity of real world data on the current use and trends of use of raltegravir. This study will look at patients recently initiated on raltegravir, with adequate follow-up to determine some basic outcome measures. It is anticipated that this will include a large proportion of patients in the older age group, given use in patients with comorbid conditions and that in some centres 1st line use is uncommon.Primary Objective(s): To describe why, in whom and how raltegravir is being used in clinical practice in 8 treatment centres in the UKStudy Design: Retrospective database analysis. Data will be collected using a standardised tool across all sites. There will be 8 sites in total, four in London and four outside London. Each centre will be asked to review their database and pharmacy records beginning from the 1st of April 2013 and working backwards to include the most recent patients who meet the inclusion criteria. The study will continue reviewing patient records until 40 patients within each centre have a least 12 months of follow up data available. Study Population: HIV-1 infected adults initiating raltegravir as part of antiretroviral treatment (ART) at treatment centres within the UK, on or prior to the 1st of April 2013. Study Duration: 12 monthsExposure and Outcome: To describe the characteristics of patients prescribed raltegravir the following information will be captured: basic demographics, reasons for starting raltegravir, concomitant ARV and non-ARV medications, number of previous regimens, raltegravir resistance data, co-morbidities, viral load and baseline CD4 count. To aid the detection of differences in raltegravir use between centres, each site will be asked to complete a survey assessing local policy and raltegravir use in scenarios including pregnancy, HIV-2 and post exposure prophylaxis (PEP).\n",

Therefor the classification of children according to their pubertal group is of major importance, since children with a late or very late pubertal growth spur onset may be misdiagnosed as non-responders to rhGH and prematurely suspend their treatment, preventing them from reaching their full potential height.The Auxogrowth study intends to include the date of pubertal/post pubertal Spanish children treated with Omnitrope¬Æ on the AuxoLog program in order to evaluate their growth.It will include pubescent or post-pubescent children with GHD treated with Omnitrope¬Æ for at least two years before the onset of puberty with data available from at least one GH production stimulation test.Its objectives are to assess the increase in stature and growth rate in pubertal/post pubertal GHD children treated with Omnitrope¬Æ for a minimum of two years and to classify them according to time of pubertal development.

It has been reported that some chronic exposure to drugs can modulate the risk of CRC, and it has been studied possible preventive measures to detect if some exposures may increase the risk of CRC. Most current information comes from studies in Anglo-Saxon or northern European countries. Our population characteristics (lower cardiovascular risk and different diet) may determine baseline differences in risk. It is important to see if there are changes CRC risk associated with drugs already described in other populations, whose dietary characteristics are also observed and cardiovascular risk are different. It is therefore proposed to study CRC risk associated with drug exposures described as protective or risk factors. In addition, the retrospective study of chronic exposure to a broad spectrum of drugs in an affected population of CRC could allow associations identification previously undescribed. These associations could be evaluated in detail in order to generate new hypotheses. This case-control study assesses the association between CRC and chronic exposure to drugs.It will be obtain data from the Information System for the Improvement of Research in Primary Care (clinical variables, laboratory and prescribed medication) in 2010-2015, including more than 5,000 cases with the diagnosis of CRC and its controls.

The study will be performed by using electronic case report forms for all data obtained by the participating physicians as well as conventional paper-pencil pain questionnaires/diaries to obtain patient-reported data throughout the whole 12-week observation period. Patient questionnaires/diaries used were those recommended by the German Pain Association and the German Pain League.Patients eligible for this study are males and non-pregnant, non-lactating females who are at least 18 years with a documented history of moderate to severe non-malignant chronic low back pain, previously treated with WHO-step I or II analgesics with or without adjuvant treatments who experienced either insufficient pain relief and/or unacceptable side effects and who require an around-the clock therapy with any of the three mentioned WHO-step III opioids. Exclusion criteria for this study are those contraindications listed in the German prescribing information of the three opioid analgesics that address situations that would place the patient at risk upon exposure to the medication as well as conditions that would confound the analysis and/or interpretation of the study results.Efficacy assessments wil be performed on the basis of patient-reported information documented in the German Pain Questionnaire (at baseline) and the German Pain Diary (throughout the whole observation period) for pain intensity, pain-related disabilities in daily life activities/functionality and quality-of-life.

However, research shows widespread use of ICS in patients with mild and moderate disease, meaning more patients are exposed to risks of side effects than would be expected under current guidelines. High doses of ICS as those typically prescribed to COPD patients have been linked to increased risks of diabetes onset and progression, yet no study has investigated this association in a cohort of COPD patients in the UK. The proposed study will investigate whether ICS treatment in COPD patients with comorbid type II diabetes has a negative impact on diabetic control, and determine whether COPD patients treated with ICS outside of guidelines are at unnecessary risk of diabetes progression. The intended audience for this study is prescribers. We plan to publish the results of this study initially at a conference, then as a manuscript in a peer-reviewed journal.\n",

Owing to small numbers of pregnancy exposures in the past, little is known about the safety of FP when used during pregnancy. Now, however, there are sufficient 1st trimester exposed pregnancies on the General Practice Research Database to allow the overall risk of major congenital malformations (MCMs) following exposure to FP to be evaluated. This study aims to evaluate the safety profile of FP compared with exposure to all other ICS with all MCMs combined as the primary endpoint whilst taking into account potential confounders and exposure to other asthma medicines. Analyses will be carried out separately for FP alone and FP in combination. If appropriate the two groups will be combined.In order to give an overall picture of the risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with asthma in general and different levels of asthma control, irrespective of the products used for treatment, this study will also evaluate - 1.

            "study_description BACKGROUND:Acute pain after axillary lymphadenectomy is often related mainly to axillary surgery. The aim of the prospective randomized study was to find out if continuous wound infusion of local anaesthetic reduces postoperative pain, consumption of opioids and the incidence of chronic pain compared to the standard intravenous piritramide analgesia after axillary lymphadenectomy in breast carcinoma patients.METHODS:Altogether 60 patients were enrolled in the prospective randomized study, half in wound infusion of local anaesthetic and half in the standard (piritramide) group.RESULTS:In the recovery room and on the first day after surgical procedure, the wound infusion of local anaesthetic group reported less acute and chronic pain, a lower consumption of piritramide and metoclopramide, but their alertness after the surgical procedure was higher compared to the standard group.CONCLUSIONS:After axillary lymphadenectomy in breast carcinoma patients, wound infusion of local anaesthetic reduces acute pain and enables reduced opioid consumption, resulting in less postoperative sedation and a reduced need for antiemetic drugs. After wound infusion of local anaesthetic there is a statistical trend for reduction of chronic pain.\n",

            "title Does a continuous local anaesthetic pain treatment after immediate tissue expander reconstruction in breast carcinoma patients more efficiently reduce acute postoperative pain - a prospective randomised study (DCLAE)\n",
            "study_description Background:Immediate breast reconstruction with an expander is a reasonable option for properly selected patients. After reconstruction, patients have severe postoperative pain, which responds poorly to opioids. Our aim was to evaluate if continuous wound infusion of a local anaesthetic into the surgical wound reduces postoperative pain, consumption of opioids and incidence of chronic pain compared to standard intravenous piritramide after primary breast reconstruction in breast carcinoma patients.Methods:Altogether, 60 patients were enrolled in our study, one half in the group with wound infusion of a local anaesthetic, and the other half in the standard (piritramide) group. Parameters measured included: pain intensity (visual analogue scale), drug requirements, alertness, hospitalisation, side-effects and late complications. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results:In the recovery room, the test group reported less acute pain at rest( P=0.03) and at activity (P= 0.01), and on the day of the surgical procedure they reported less pain at activity (P= 0.003). Consumption of piritramideand metoclopramide was lower in this group (P< 0.0001), but their alertness after the surgical procedure was higher compared to the standard group (P< 0.001). After three months, the test group reported less chronic pain (P=0.01).Conclusions:After primary tissue expander breast reconstruction, wound infusion of a local anaesthetic significantly reduces acute pain and enables reduced opioid consumption, resulting in less postoperative sedation and reduced need for antiemetic drugs. Wound infusion of a local anaesthetic reduces chronic pain.\n",

            "study_description Biosimilars are biologic medicines that enter the market subsequent to an original reference product whose patent has expired. Biosimilar infliximab CT-P13 received EMA approval in 2013 and was granted marketing authorization for all of the indications of the reference product, based on parallel-group clinical trials in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis. Therefore, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are considered as extrapolated indications. Concerns have been expressed regarding extrapolated indications. The dosing is different in RA (3 mg/kg b.w.) and in rheumatologic diseases combination therapy is more frequently used, which may influence immunogenicity. As of May, 2014 the Hungarian National Health Fund only reimburses the biosimilar infliximab for new induction treatment in IBD. New induction is defined as no infliximab treatment in the previous 12 month, switch was not allowed. Data on the safety and efficacy of biosimilar infliximab in clinical practice in IBD is limited so far. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to conduct a prospective, nationwide, multicentre, observational cohort to examine the efficacy and safety of CT-P13 infliximab biosimilar in the induction and maintenance treatment of Crohn‚Äôs disease and ulcerative colitis. The primary endpoint of the study was early clinical remission at week 14. Secondary endpoints include early clinical response at week 14, steroid-free clinical remission at week 30, sustained clinical remission and response at week 54, early and sustained biochemical response at week 14 and week 54, mucosal healing at week 54 and safety. Consecutive IBD patients starting on infliximab biosimilar were prospectively enrolled and a standardized monitoring strategy was applied. Demographic data, medication history, clinical, laboratory and endoscopic/radiological imaging were collected. Infliximab trough and anti-drug antibodies were measured at regular intervals. Adverse events were registered.\n",

            "study_description Almost 250,000 ovarian cancers are diagnosed worldwide each year. Incidence rates are high in northern Europe, including in Ireland and the UK. These countries have among the highest ovarian cancer mortality rates in the world. The relatively young average age and advanced stage at diagnosis, mean that ovarian cancer is a major burden. Lab-based research suggests that various commonly-used drugs (statins, beta-blockers and NSAIDs) might have potent anti-tumour effects in ovarian cancer. We will combine estimates from cancer registry linked, pharmacoepidemiology databases from Ireland (NCRI/PCRS), Northern Ireland (NICR/EPD) and Great Britain (CPRD/NCDR), to investigate associations between exposure to these three drug groups and ovarian cancer presentation, progression and outcomes. There are three outcomes of interest: (A) associations between pre-diagnosis drug exposure and stage at diagnosis, (B) associations between exposure to drugs and disease recurrence and (C) associations between exposure to drugs and cancer related mortality. Analysis of stage will use a nested case-control design and be performed using conditional logistic regression. Analyses of other outcomes will use a retrospective cohort design to investigate associations between pre- and post-diagnosis exposure. Cox proportional hazards models, with adjustment for known confounders will be used and the lagged time-varying covariate approach will be used to evaluate post-diagnosis exposure. Cohort estimates will be combined in a prospective meta-analysis.\n",

            "study_description The major challenge concerning the treatment of diabetes is representended by the prevention of vascular and metabolic diabetic complications and the related consequences for the health status of patients.Human insulin and/or its analogues are used to treat both type 1 diabetes mellitus, from its first onset, and type 2 diabetes, in its advanced phase. For both types of insulin, different formulations with different time to onset and duration of action, are currently available in order to provide patients with the most appropriate therapeutic option to mantain blood glucose concenration within the phisiological range throughout the day. In fact, different long-term follow-up studies of randomized clinical trials have found an association between inadequate plasma glucose control and the occurrence of diabetes complications. Insulin analogues possess benefit relative to human insulins in terms of glycemic control however, little is known about the long-term comparative effectiveness of insulin analogue with respect to human insulins in reducing the risk of cardiovascular and metabolic complications of diabetes. The main objective of this study was to assess the risk of diabetes complications in patients treated with insulin analogues against those using human insulin in a clinical pratice setting (i.e. Tuscany region). The secondary scope of this study was to evaluate healthcare costs respectively associated with the use of human insulins and insulin analogues (e.g. pharmacological treatment related to diabetes, hospitalizations, diagnostic procedures).\n",

            "study_description Background: The Portuguese National Health Directorate has issued guidelines on prescription of anti-inflammatory drugs, acid suppressive therapy, and antiplatelets. However, their effectiveness in changing actual practice is unknown. Methods: The study will compare the effectiveness of educational outreach visits regarding the improvement of clinical guidelines compliance with usual dissemination strategies. A cost-benefit analysis will also be conducted. We will carry out a parallel, open, superiority, randomized trial directed to primary care physicians. Physicians will be recruited and allocated at a cluster-level (primary care unit) by minimization. Data will be analyzed at the physician level. Primary care units will be eligible if they use electronic prescribing and have at least four physicians willing to participate. Physicians in intervention units will be offered individual educational outreach visits (one for each guideline) at their workplace during a six months period. Physicians in the control group will be offered a single unrelated group training session. Primary outcomes will be the proportion of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors prescribed in the anti-inflammatory class, and the proportion of omeprazole in the proton pump inhibitors class at 18 months post-intervention. Prescription data will be collected from the regional pharmacy claims database. We estimated a sample size of 110 physicians in each group, corresponding to 19 clusters with a mean size of 6 physicians. Outcome collection and data analysis will be blinded to allocation, but due to the nature of the intervention physicians and detailers cannot be blinded.Discussion: This trial will attempt to address unresolved issues in the literature, namely, long term persistence of effect, the importance of sequential visits in an outreach program, and cost issues. If successful, this trial may be the cornerstone for deploying large scale educational outreach programs in Portugal.\n",

            "study_description Background: Patients may increase spontaneuos reporting system and contribute to the detection of signals. Community pharmacies could have an important role in this context as a service for promoting patient reporting of ADRs. A pilot study was conducted in 2010 in the Veneto Region of Italy to increase the patient reporting through the role of the pharmacist. This project had so good results we decided to extend it to a mullti- regional level. Objectives: to assess the potential impact of an intevention to promote patient reporting in community pharmacies and to compare the characteristics of patients and general practitioners reports of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Methods: Eight regional centres (Basilicata, Calabria, Campania, Friuli-Venezia Giulia,Lazio, Puglia Bari, Puglia Barletta, Veneto) have been involved in the study. Each pharmacist was asked to select, during the study period, about 240 customers who had received at least one drug and then to offer the spontaneuos reporting form to those who had experienced a suspected ADRs. Patients were asked to complete the ADR report form and either give it back to the pharmacist o send it by fax or email or else to fill in the form online. Preliminary results: in a 3-month period (from October 2013 to March 2014) the study involved 615 pharmacists working in 388 community pharmacies. 115,055 patients (58% female) were interviewed by the pharmacists and 12,185 (10,6%) referred a suspected ADR. The project has collected a total of about 4,000 citizen‚Äôs ADR reporting form, corresponding to about 30% of all patients interviewed who had experienced suspected ADRs. After a quality control about 60% of these reports were entered into the Italian Pharmacovigilance Database. A comparison with the reports sent by the general practitioners in the same region and in the same period is in progress. Further results will be published as soon as available.\n",

More recently evidence has been building of an association between aspirin use and reduced mortality in both meta-analyses and observational studies. The biological mechanisms proposed are the anti-platelet activity of aspirin, which may impede the spread of metastases, and also through the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) enzyme, expressed in response to tumour growth factors and inflammation. Studies have reported COX-2 to be expressed at higher levels in higher grade tumours, which are associated with poorer outcomes. In prostate cancer the associations between aspirin use and reduced mortality have been strongest in men with localised disease. This study aims to examine the associations between aspirin use and mortality in men diagnosed with high grade prostate tumours. The analysis will be stratified by tumour stage, to assess whether the association between aspirin use and prostate cancer mortality is modified according to whether the disease is localised or advanced.\n",

It is, however, highly teratogenic when used during the first trimester of pregnancy and as a result, pregnancy prevention programs (PPPs) are in place committing female isotretinoin users to use ‚â•2 means of contraception. Research indicates that often, female isotretinoin users are unaware of these measures or do not adhere to them and the question arises as to why this should be the case. To ensure efficacy of PPPs, we need to determine what makes PPPs fail and what can be done to improve adherence. This study aims to use a combination of quantitative and qualitative research to provide an overview of isotretinoin use in women of childbearing age, to evaluate the effectiveness of the PPP and to develop and provide recommendations for improving the effectiveness of PPPs in Europe. The first 2 components of the study will use data from electronic healthcare databases in three European countries to determine the prevalence of oral isotretinoin use in females of childbearing age, to characterise its use in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics and to estimate factors predictive of PPP failure and the occurrence of pregnancies in women of childbearing age using isotretinoin. The qualitative component of the study will involve conducting interviews with women who have experienced a ‚Äòbreakthrough pregnancy‚Äô whilst taking isotretinoin. In addition to the interviews a consultation exercise with a committee constituting representatives from across Europe of stakeholders from dermatology, hospital and community pharmacy, general practice, fertility specialists, teratology information services as well as female user representatives of childbearing potential will be carried out.

            "study_description PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to measure persistence with pharmacological treatment in the specialist mental healthcare of patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression in Lombardy, a region of 10 million inhabitants located in the northernmost part of Italy.METHODS: The data concerning psychiatric care used in this study were retrieved from the regional Psychiatric Information System, while information on drug treatment was retrieved from the regional administrative database. Time to lack of persistence with initial pharmacological treatment was the outcome measure.RESULTS: A total of 11,797 patients, followed in the specialist mental healthcare system, started a new pharmacological treatment for depression, schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder during 2007. Overall, 8,500 patients (72.1%) discontinued treatment during the 12 month follow-up, with a median duration of 101 days. Very similar discontinuation rates were observed in patients with unipolar depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. In the multivariate analysis, operational definitions of continuity and intensity of care were the most robust determinants of persistence with drug treatment in each of the three cohorts of psychiatric diagnoses.CONCLUSIONS: High rates of treatment discontinuation were found in a population of patients with severe mental disorders followed in the specialist mental healthcare system of an Italian region, with no differences among patients with unipolar major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. These findings corroborate the notion that the problem of treatment discontinuation in psychiatric disorders is a factor related to the capacity of the mental health system to assure and maintain continuity and intensity of care.\n",

            "study_description Using case-control methodology, the ISICA study aims to primarily assess the relative risk of breast cancer associated with the use of individual insulins as compared to non-insulin use in patients with diabetes. Analysis will appraise individual mitigating or risk factors such as oral antidiabetic agents, type of diabetes, gestational diabetes, life-time history of BMI, reproduction related factors, oral contraceptives, hormonal replacement therapy, 1st degree relative cancer, socioeconomic status, behavioural risk, among other. Also, a number of biological parameters will be assessed (HER2, estrogens or progesterone receptors, circulating insulin). Firstly, a registry of patients with breast cancer, diagnosed with a first positive biopsy between January 2008 and June 2009 (time of alert), are identified through medical charts by a network of 88 centres across the UK, France and Canada. Secondly, case-subjects defined as those additionally suffering from diabetes, are identified. At least 1,000 of such patients are expected to meet this criterion and 750 to be included. Eligible subjects will be female, 18 years-old or more, without previous history of breast cancer, willing and able to participate. Control-subjects are defined as patients with diabetes fulfilling the same eligibility criteria and free of cancer at the time of match to cases. Controls will be independently recruited from general medical practices. An average of four controls will likely be matched to each case according to type of diabetes, age, country and region, totalling 3,000 controls. Exposure to insulin and other drugs will be collected from patients‚Äô general practitioners/pharmacy records. All patients will be interviewed for individual risk factors. Descriptive analysis andmultivariable modelling will be done for case-control comparisons. The study results are expected in 2012.\n",

Recently, it has been proposed that cancer progression may be prevented by medicines in current use including beta-blockers (used to treat hypertension). We previously demonstrated that beta-blockers inhibit migration in breast and prostate cancer cells and in an observational study showed marked reductions in cancer-associated mortality and metastasis in breast cancer patients using beta-blockers. This study will be the largest yet to investigate beta-blockers and cancer progression in breast cancer patients. GPRD data allow detailed analysis of the timing of drug exposure and the effect on various outcome measures including mortality, cancer-specific mortality and cancer recurrence. Importantly, an analysis will use robust cancer data from UK cancer registries and robust death data (from the Office of National Statistics).\n",

            "study_description A variety of complementary approaches are needed to evaluate safety of medicine use in pregnancy. To evaluate safety in relation to teratogenicity (capacity to cause malformations), population-based congenital anomalies registers, which are already networked across Europe (EUROCAT) with a common database, can provide a cost-effective mechanism which is as yet underexploited. The enormous population coverage of registers when combined gives sufficient statistical power for the identification of associations between specific drugs and specific malformations. This project will develop and test an efficient pharmaco-vigilance system for safety of drugs during pregnancy in relation to teratogenicity by (i) enhancing the information regarding drug exposure in the EUROCAT database, covering a total population of 6 million births 1995-2010, through linkage to electronic databases containing prescription information, and by linkage to chronic disease cohorts (ii) analysing the enhanced EUROCAT database in relation to four drug groups of public health concern ‚Äì new antiepileptics, insulin analogs, SSRI antidepressants, and antiasthmatics ‚Äì exposure to all of which is increasing in the pregnancy population (iii) interrogating health care databases to monitor the effectiveness of drug safety recommendations and pregnancy prevention programmes through drug utilisation studies, and to provide an exposure profile for pregnant women (iv) conducting a scoping study of the implications for drug safety of growing internet use by pregnant women, in terms of access to safety information about teratogenicity, and access to drugs with teratogenic potential.\n",

            "study_description Tuberculosis represents nowadays one of the main problems in public health both in non-developed as in developed countries. The increase of the incidence of tuberculosis during the last years has been related to an increase in complications derived from its treatment, based on the use of isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide, as well as to the appearance of resistance, therapeutic failure or hepatotoxicity. In particular, hepatotoxicity due to anti-tuberculous drugs is a relevant problem for the scientific community as it results in the modification of the treatment and in liver transplantation or death in the most extreme situations.We propose the study of a cohort of patients who initiate treatment or profilaxis with antituberculous drugs, with the aim of identifying those presenting a high risk of developing hepatotoxicity. Therefore, we propose the analysis of the serum proteomic profiles of these patients. The main goal is the identification and characterisation of biological markers which would be predictive of hepatotoxicity associated with anti-tuberculous drugs.\n",

            "study_description Questionnaires for measuring quality of life in patients with inflammatory bowel disease usually include a large number of items and are time-consuming for both administration and interpretation. Our aim was to elaborate and validate a short quality-of-life questionnaire with the most representative items from the Spanish version of the 36-item Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ-36) using the Rasch analysis. The responses to 311 IBDQ-36 questionnaires from 167 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 144 with Crohn's disease (CD) were analyzed. IBDQ-36 was shortened with successive Rasch analyses until all the remaining items showed acceptable separation and goodness-of-fit properties. Validation of the short questionnaire was studied in a new group of 125 patients by determining its validity and reliability. A 9-item short questionnaire was obtained (IBDQ-9). Its correlation with IBDQ-36 was excellent (r = 0.91). Correlation between IBDQ-9 and clinical indices of activity was statistically significant in UC (r = 0.70) and CD (r= 0.70). IBDQ-9 score discriminates adequately between patients in clinical remission or relapse (P < 0.01). Sensitivity to change was determined in 14 patients who improved clinically, showing significant IBDQ-9 changes between both determinations (P < 0.01), with an effect size of -2.67 in UC and -5.29 in CD. IBDQ-9 was also homogeneous, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.95 in UC and 0.91 in CD. In 35-clinically stable patients, test-retest reliability was good, with a statistically-significant correlation between both questionnaires (r = 0.76 in UC and 0.86 in CD, P < 0.01) and an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.82 in UC and 0.84 in CD. In conclusion, a short and valid questionnaire to measure quality of life in patients with inflammatory bowel disease was obtained using a new measurement model. Its use should facilitate comprehension of the impact of inflammatory bowel disease.\n",
